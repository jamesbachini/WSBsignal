Dow futures implied an opening gain of nearly 200 points. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq futures also were higher as Wall Street appears to be withstanding concerns about the Reddit-sparked retail trading frenzy. In the month of January, the Dow dropped 2%; the S&amp;P 500 fell 1%; and the Nasdaq rose 1.4%. (CNBC)\nTreasury yields fall as Republican senators call for scaled back stimulus (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Silver futures were soaring by more than 10% in early trading, as the metals market appears to be the latest area impacted by Reddit-fueled trading. It represents the biggest move for silver futures since at least 2013. Silver and silver-related equities also posted strong gains late last week, which seems to be linked to interest from retail traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Melvin Capital Management lost 53% in January as GameStop (GME) and other stocks the hedge fund had bet against saw massive rallies after retail traders piled into the heavily shorted names. Melvin Capital told CNBC it closed its short position in GameStop early last week after recording a big loss.

(CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Robinhood is continuing to place trading restrictions during today’s session on GameStop and other stocks that have recently seen huge rallies and major volatility. Users of the popular brokerage app can only buy one share of GameStop and five options contracts. There are seven other stocks with various trading limits including AMC Entertainment (AMC), Koss Corp. (KOSS) and the retailer Express (EXPR). Robinhood’s restricted list for today’s session is smaller than the 50 names that had trading limitations Friday.

The Republican senators, including Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah, say their proposal provides “more targeted assistance” to the Americans who have the greatest needs. Biden, who has proposed a $1.9 trillion relief package, has agreed to meet with the Republicans. (CNBC / NBC News)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * A former Covid advisor to Biden said the U.S. should alter its vaccine distribution plans in order to administer more first doses and get ahead of a looming wave of infection. “The fact is that the surge that is likely to occur with this new variant from England is going to happen in the next six to 14 weeks,” Dr. Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “If we see that happen, which my 45 years in the trenches tell me we will, we are going to see something like we have not seen yet in this country.” (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Covid vaccines: Rollout in disarray in U.S. and abroad (NBC News)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Myanmar’s military has detained senior politicians in the country, including Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, as part of a coup to seize power in the Southeast Asian nation. The military said its actions were required because the government did not attend to the military’s claims of fraud in the country’s November election. It also claimed its actions were necessary because the election was held during the Covid pandemic. (Associated Press)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Russian prosecutors seek Navalny jail term as Kremlin tells U.S. to back off (Reuters)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * In a discussion on the audio app Clubhouse, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said late Sunday he was a “supporter” of bitcoin. “I think bitcoin is really on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people,” said Musk, the world’s wealthiest person. He added that he should have bought the cryptocurrency years ago at the urging of friends. Last week, Musk added “bitcoin” to his Twitter bio, which briefly helped push up the price of the digital coin. Bitcoin, which has had a massive rally in the last year, is trading at nearly $34,000 per coin. (CNBC)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; * Former President Donald Trump has selected two new attorneys to lead his defense team in the upcoming Senate impeachment trial, which is set to begin Feb. 9. Lawyers David Schoen and Bruce Castor are now in charge of Trump’s defense after an abrupt shakeup in the legal team. The Senate is considering whether to convict Trump on an article of impeachment passed by the House of Representatives related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol.

Welcome to Tuesday! Happy Groundhog Day! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-2-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 1. Dow looks for back-to-back gains after last week’s decline\n\n&gt; * The Dow is set to rise over 200 points at Tuesday’s open, looking for a second day of gains after last week’s nearly 3.3% decline. The 30-stock average Monday clawed back 229 points of Friday’s 620 point drop as Wall Street appeared to shake off concerns about the speculative retail trading mania that largely drove the market’s worst weekly sell-off since October.\nWith gains Monday, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 were once again positive for 2021, joining the Nasdaq. However, the three stock benchmarks remained below last month’s record closing highs, with the Dow over 3% away and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq each about 2% away. Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon are set to report quarterly earnings after Tuesday’s closing bell.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 2. GameStop’s decline accelerates as Robinhood raises more money\n\n&gt; * GameStop continued to lose ground in Tuesday’s premarket trading, with shares of the volatile retail investor-favorite sliding 40% to around $133. The tumble follows a more than 30% drop during the regular market session Monday after last week’s 400% gain, which saw shares as high as $483 each. Before Tuesday’s open, the stock had gained more than 1,000% in 2021 as users on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum talked up the videogame retailer and crushed short-sellers betting against the stock.\nRobinhood said it raised another $2.4 billion from investors to weather the extreme market swings due to the trading frenzy in GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks. The overall $3.4 billion the online brokerage has mobilized since Thursday exceeds its total funding amount since its founding in 2013.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 3. Pfizer raised full-year guidance after mixed quarter\n\n&gt; * Pfizer expects to sell about $15 billion in coronavirus vaccine doses this year, the U.S. drug giant said Tuesday as it reported mixed quarterly results. Adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of 42 cents per share fell 6 cents short of expectations. Revenue in Q4 rose 12% to $11.68 billion, exceeding estimates. Pfizer also raised full-year guidance. Shares were flat in the premarket. Pfizer has said it expects to deliver 200 million doses of its two-shot vaccine to the U.S. by the end of July.\n\n*****\n\n&gt; # 4. Democrats move to go it alone on Biden’s Covid relief package\n\n&gt; * Democratic congressional leaders took the first step toward passing a sweeping coronavirus relief bill without GOP support, as President Joe Biden on Monday heard out a much smaller plan from Republicans. The Republican lawmakers on Sunday put forward a $618 billion counteroffer to Biden’s $1.9 trillion rescue package. The GOP proposal would send a smaller $1,000 direct payment to many Americans, and extend a smaller $300 per week federal unemployment benefits boost and only until June 30.

Dow looks for back-to-back gains after last week’s decline&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Dow is set to rise over 200 points at Tuesday’s open, looking for a second day of gains after last week’s nearly 3.3% decline. The 30-stock average Monday clawed back 229 points of Friday’s 620 point drop as Wall Street appeared to shake off concerns about the speculative retail trading mania that largely drove the market’s worst weekly sell-off since October.\nWith gains Monday, the Dow and S&amp;amp;P 500 were once again positive for 2021, joining the Nasdaq. However, the three stock benchmarks remained below last month’s record closing highs, with the Dow over 3% away and the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq each about 2% away. Google-parent Alphabet and Amazon are set to report quarterly earnings after Tuesday’s closing bell.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;2. GameStop’s decline accelerates as Robinhood raises more money&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GameStop continued to lose ground in Tuesday’s premarket trading, with shares of the volatile retail investor-favorite sliding 40% to around $133. The tumble follows a more than 30% drop during the regular market session Monday after last week’s 400% gain, which saw shares as high as $483 each. Before Tuesday’s open, the stock had gained more than 1,000% in 2021 as users on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum talked up the videogame retailer and crushed short-sellers betting against the stock.\nRobinhood said it raised another $2.4 billion from investors to weather the extreme market swings due to the trading frenzy in GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks. The overall $3.4 billion the online brokerage has mobilized since Thursday exceeds its total funding amount since its founding in 2013.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;3. Pfizer raised full-year guidance after mixed quarter&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pfizer expects to sell about $15 billion in coronavirus vaccine doses this year, the U.S. drug giant said Tuesday as it reported mixed quarterly results. Adjusted fourth-quarter earnings of 42 cents per share fell 6 cents short of expectations. Revenue in Q4 rose 12% to $11.68 billion, exceeding estimates. Pfizer also raised full-year guidance. Shares were flat in the premarket. Pfizer has said it expects to deliver 200 million doses of its two-shot vaccine to the U.S. by the end of July.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;4. Democrats move to go it alone on Biden’s Covid relief package&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Democratic congressional leaders took the first step toward passing a sweeping coronavirus relief bill without GOP support, as President Joe Biden on Monday heard out a much smaller plan from Republicans. The Republican lawmakers on Sunday put forward a $618 billion counteroffer to Biden’s $1.9 trillion rescue package. The GOP proposal would send a smaller $1,000 direct payment to many Americans, and extend a smaller $300 per week federal unemployment benefits boost and only until June 30. Biden left the door open to passing a bill without Republicans if he cannot reach a deal with GOP lawmakers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;5.

To curb the spread of Covid-19, the CDC issued the mask-wearing rule late Friday that builds on executive action announced by Biden on Jan. 21. The enforcement, which could include fines, will be handled by the TSA and other federal, state and local authorities. The order extends to waiting areas such as airports, train platforms and subway stations.

Before we begin, this is not financial advice, if you want financial advice to lose money, turn on CNBC.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nWith no more bankruptcy worries, additional liquidity, a reopening trade with more vaccines coming through the funnel, and with additional hype surrounding the brand, revenues should increase in FY2021 and FY2022+, giving AMC potential to reach prior highs at the $35 area, w/o a short squeeze. With? $60+. Important to note: The expected liquidation value post liquidity injection this past week, would be HIGHER than the current market cap. Also Blackrock now has a 5%+ stake in AMC. Bet with the suits that the FED trusts.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nWhat a crazy time, where the internet fights against greedy hedge funds and boomers who don’t manage their risk and over-short various equities. Not a surprise, as the wise Gordon Gecko once stated, Greed is Good. Now it seems it’s legal. Because everyone is drinking the same Kool-Aid.\n\nWell, some of these funds got bailed out last Thursday in some of the largest VISIBLE market manipulation you can ever see, where individuals were only allowed to sell shares and many were FORCED to sell shares into a price well below the price equilibrium. What does that mean? To refresh the Econ 101 class lesson that the hedgies snorted coke through, when you cut Demand by say, 70%, yet force the supply to stay near the same or even increase, the price paid per, in this case, share, will be SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER than the fair market price. To Robinhood, TDA, and any other big firm that made a point to lower the fair market price of the various equities ranging from GME, AMC, BB, and others, I hope the SEC can get off their paid off asses and do their job for the American people. Also, to the Biden Administration that stands for the people, unity, and liberty, get off your lazy asses and do your goddamn job. We know many of the various representatives and organizations are corrupt, but at least catch the hand that’s still in the cookie jar.\n\nNow lets begin with AMC’s true value, and most importantly, what their future value is.\n\n**The Cons**:\n\nOne of the biggest issues that loomed over AMC’s head was bankruptcy. And it was a BIG fucking problem. So much so, the equity went from trading at $30+ to sub $5, especially hit by the pandemic and all it’s wonderful externalities. Back in April and May, two firms actually upgraded this stock with more positive outlooks, B. Riley FBR with a target of $4, and MKM Partners (sound familiar from 2.1.21?) with a target of $5 claiming that their risk of bankruptcy is lower and with the reopening of theatres possible from Covid presumably coming to more of a halt. Well today, the brilliant mind at MKM, Eric Handler, decided to downgrade the stock again with a price target of $1. Surprising, since they actually got a cash infusion recently by offering shares… Wait what? Oh yeah, wall street analysts are as much of a joke as their predictions of the future. No wonder they are so wrong all the time. Eric, I get you want to get your inner Kanye out but please take the medication before you put out a completely illogical downgrade compared to your firms last upgrade and PT. You do have a fiduciary responsibility, after all.\n\n**Financials**:\n\nRecently, AMC actually raised a ton of cash even before any offering of shares or anything of the like. To quote the President and CEO of AMC, Adam Aron, “Any talk of an imminent bankruptcy for AMC is completely off the table.” Then the stock RAN from 3 to 25 in a short period of time, and AMC did what TSLA does best, they raised cash. In fact they extended their cash lines by a smidge over $1B USD. Heh, not bad to combat bankruptcy.\n\n*Lets look at YOY ER:*\n\n\nWe will get Full FY2020 results on 2.25, lets use the numbers we have already.\n\n\n\nAttribute\t|FY 2020\t|FY2019\t|FY2018\n---|---|----|----\nTotal Revenue\t|2,527.60\t|5,471.00\t|5,460.80\nGross Profit\t|1,654.30\t|3,493.20\t|3,479.70\nOperating Expense\t|5,617.30\t|5,335.00\t|5,195.80\nOperating Income\t|-3,089.70\t|136.00\t|265.00\nNet Income\t|-3,656.80\t|-149.10\t|110.10\n\nOperating Expenses aren’t pretty, but a bulk is from Q1 and since, Covid has been a slaughter.\nNow how to we recover from a very dreary year? Pretty simple: Have cash to stave off upcoming costs, start opening up your theatres so that you can get those rev. numbers up, and begin partnering with old and new media companies in ways that haven’t been as exposed in the past, creating new revenue streams. Now lets go through these.\n\n**News Events**\n\nAMC announced that they will be able to last months before raising additional cash this past week. They then proceeded to raise over a billion dollars.\n\nAMC announced that they will now be opening a majority of their theatres again. Movie releases will start to come back, per the industry.\n\nBlackrock, one of the largest investment banks on the planet, has a +5% stake within the company,\n\nJNJ and NVAX announced their Phase 3 vaccine results with decent efficacy. Reopening needs this as larger vaccine availability means a quicker reopening trade.\n\nA bolstering of hype surrounding the company by the common man, with hundreds of millions of eyes if not billions, increasing net exposure of this once beloved brand to the general public yet again. Think movies were coming back? Now they are going to be back, bigly.\n\nA short squeeze was set off recently as well, costing funds who were short AMC hundreds of millions to potentially over a billion dollars. This is one of the main driving forces brought to AMC, which we will cover below.\n\n**Needs to survive**:\n\nHave cash? Well recent funding and stock sales provides liquidity. AMC will survive FY2021. Check!\nStart opening theatres? Vaccine distribution is to expand exponentially, especially with the results of JNJ and NVAX covid vaccines adding onto PFE and MRNA’s. Biden admin ftw? Time for AMC to get some revs back. Check!\nNew rev streams? This is something that AMC will need to work on, and in my opinion, are underexposed to.\n\nIt is my belief that this is one thing stopping AMC from becoming a TITAN, with their reach and location across the country, there are many major and minor partnerships that can be started to generate revenue, especially in a post-covid world. NFLX on the big screen? Doable, even with potential discounts for NFLX customers. Disney+, same! Streaming will have its moment of fatigue and film will be a fad, but there are many many avenues to attack the entertainment senses of a theatre attendee. What if Epic Games utilized AMC to throw some of their concerts, having individuals log in to a server of that theatre or theatres to attend some crazy concerts with their parents and other kids/teens just like them? I would love for AMC to bring on new members into the board to enhance the theatre experience. Food for thought to CEO Aron.\n\n**Short Float**:\n\nNow this is something very important with the recent momentum in this stock. According to finviz, as of today, 2.1.21, the short float is at a whopping 43.82%. Issue with finviz that I am seeing, is that there are only 107 MM shares outstanding, looking like a pretty significant ~47 MM are short. I’m seeing that there are 339 MM shares outstanding, so if that number can align, the amount of shares short are triple at 120 MM, which wouldn’t surprise me given the lovely and reputable news stories we get from CNBC, Bloomberg, and whatever sorry piece of shit that thinks that reddit is targeting a short squeeze in a $1.5 Trillion dollar market in Silver, as well as other useless coins.\n\n**Longing the stock**\n\nWith the biggest concern to AMC, bankruptcy, behind them now, we can safely say it is worth it to look at the stock in a more elevated view. Let’s proceed.\n\nUpon our recent review on AMC, our projections for revs to increase to ~5.4 B from the meager numbers in 2020, with a now-healthier view on AMC’s financials and cash-on-hand due to recent strides to increase liquidity. With additional potential revenue streams of new partners who grew at WFH scenarios such as NFLX, DIS, ROKU, and others, we project that this company should be seeing more explosive growth in the next 3-5 years and have lower expectations of ~6B in revs per year, and a larger bull case of ~9-10 B in revs if expansions do occur and new revenue streams are fully actualized. Anything above is a gift.\n\nNow to actually long the equity: With RH opening up more shares allowed, other brokers allowing this equity to be traded and accepting more and more users with each day as they migrate from one of the worst brokerages around (RH), this should give more buying power into the recently popular AMC and GME trades. With such a high short rate and with many traders believing that the hype is done for, I expect additional firepower in the long trade as these traders will have to cover. Without the short %, my PT would be $20, but with, this could go quite far and squeeze anywhere between 40-60 if not beyond. It’s not really a trade as much as it is a math problem.\n\nLong AMC.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀","html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s all go to the movies, then the moon.

This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.* \n\nRather than doing a writeup of Friday, I think the time I have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics.  As I mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week, my first glance was that Friday was a low conviction, low volume day where momentum traders/and volatility arbitraging HFT algos were skirmishing, and a slightly deeper look tells me that's probably the case for almost the entire day, up to the last minutes before close.\n\nThere was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain.  Keep in mind also that on Friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with GME, and GME price was also protected from aggressive short-side attack due to the uptick rule.\n\n# Capital Flow, Liquid Float, and Price\n\nOk, so let's go with a diagram I put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze.  This is not very formal--just conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price, liquid free float, and capital required to move things around.\n\n[Capital Flow to Price Volatility Leverage Conceptual Diagram](https://u.teknik.io/DDa8Y.PNG)\n\nAs you can see in the diagram, I figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw.\n\nOn the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float, moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right, except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold, which moves the fulcrum to the left.\n\nThe lower the liquid free float, or the further to the left the fulcrum goes, the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow (net selling or buying) on share price.  Importantly, as the diagrams on the right half show, it's not a linear relationship.  The closer the liquid free float comes to 0%, the faster the price volatility increases... theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 0%.\n\nI find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify.  On the extremely liquid side, if you have all of the tens of millions of GME shares in play, dropping $10,000 in to buy shares probably doesn't even register on the ticker.  On the other extreme, if what if there was only 1 share in play?  That same $10,000 instantly prices GME at $10,000 a share--if you can even get the person holding it to sell!\n\nSince company value is estimated mark-to-market, GME would instantly become rated one of the most  (if not the most) valuable companies in the world.  This is in no way true, of course, as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price, but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned, they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to re-price the company.\n\nSo, in the grand scheme of things, in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze, the primary factor is locking up actively traded/liquid free float.  Also important to keep in mind, locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down, and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility, reaching its limit where going from 2 actively traded shares to 1 actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share.\n\nSo simple, right?  Actually, yes. However, don't mistake simple for easy (absolutely not the same thing in this case).\n\n# Market Games\n\nSo, GME and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants.  On the one hand, you have normal investors and traders who don't really pay attention to it at all, and, if they do, they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility (people tend to short stocks as price goes up, and cover shorts as price drops, so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable).\n\nThen you have what I'll call market gamers.  These are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish, and just pay attention to what they actually do.  There are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance, and shorting is one of them, as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a company's share price and actually harm the company badly.  The counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze, which gets worse with extreme price volatility.\n\nImagine it this way.  Short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange feature--a closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that, if slammed with a high enough day or week end price, blows open and sucks their account capital through, and possibly their broker's capital too, until they've patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short.\n\nThat's not how you're supposed to look at it, but that's kind of how it actually works in practice.  Most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way, but with Millenials and younger jumping in to the market we're talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing [4 minute speed runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSYY4k52GEs) through games intended to take[\\~100 hrs](https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=21614) to complete, using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers.  That's kind of what GME is like, from a certain point of view--a speed run through the market, blitzing and confusing everyone watching--throwing a ton of money at hedge funds' short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole.  Of course people are getting jumpy.\n\n# Battleground - Strategy and Tactics\n\nIn a way, GME has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people.  Wall Street vs WSB is basically the way it's been depicted in the media, and a number of them seem to be taking it personally.\n\nWith a battleground stock I find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground, but with territory marked out by stock price.  It helps you consider the impact on each 'side', what their motives are, and tactical and strategic implications.  The reason I think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground, the issue is no longer about price discovery--it's about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal, which changes the dynamics of the trade.\n\nIn my opinion, the retail strength/defensive line is at the $148 level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week.  This is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from $30 to $148, which triggered the first squeeze.\n\nMy guess is short-side strength hardens at the $350 level, based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze.  What this means is that you can expect some short-side people to actively short more at that level, possibly following through on momentum, as many of them want to prove a point that GME is a &lt;$20 stock, as stated by a number of them on CNBC.  $350 might seem like a low number given Friday's close, but remember that Friday trading was subject to the uptick rule, so the short effectively could not push back, and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the long-side advance as much as possible, and lure them off their strength as much as possible.\n\nSay what?  Is there a point to those analogies like that?  Why yes, of course, because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign.\n\nRemember, in the grand scheme of things, the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float.  That means buying and holding shares.  The question is.. how much will it cost you to move the needle on that, so to speak.  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float, the longer it'll take and the more expensive it will be.  It is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect, in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels, such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out, loosening float back up.\n\nHow about on the long side?  You want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum, and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so.  This means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair.  Why?  Because it means you're buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price (costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float) and also that their short position is at a lower average price, lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze.\n\nThe above is why, in some cases, you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze.  You can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points, which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning.  Once you think you've accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move, you spike the price back the other way and it's effectively game over.  It can take some time to play out to its conclusion, but that is the essence of it.\n\nLet's make it concrete and put some numbers to it.  let's say you need to lock up 10mio more shares for the squeeze (no idea, just using the number for easy math).  If you can buy it all skirmishing at the $200 line, you'll pay $2bn to do it.  If instead you've extended to the $300 line, you're going to pay $3bn.  If you're an alpha-seeking whale, why pay 50% more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it?  If you recall, I referenced seeing what I thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my 3rd post.\n\nThat being said, you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think you're already close to blowing up the next short interest holder.\n\nIf you think you're close, then you're looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible.\n\nThat is very similar to the price action we saw on Friday at the end of the day, as mentioned earlier.  If you think about it, if the goal is the have the price at/above a certain point at the end of the day, what is more efficient?  Rush in the morning, then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it, or wait until later in the day, as late as you think you can manage, and then push to that point at the very last tick?\n\nThat, at least, is a very high level view of what you're trying to accomplish, but it gets very complicated in the details.  If you're dueling with a good HFT algorithm, you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock (kind of like fouling someone in basketball), which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider LU/LD allowances, but still doable, even if you have to do it by sucking price level up (maybe to give you 5 mins to call your buddy at Blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that).\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind.  One of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time, is it might not be a one and done blowout (possibly on purpose).  Think about it--if you can get people to keep piling short interest in--particularly for emotional reasons, you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point.  Think of the Citron guy who re-shorted back in around what.. $90 or $100 I think?  All because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of $30.  There are people piling back in right now.  Who knows how many times they're willing to reload the short float.\n\nOk, so this post is much longer than I originally intended anyway, but I think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion.  A number of people asked me why I said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point.  If you haven't already figured out why, try to think about it, or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion.\n\nA couple of final points:\n\n* Assuming the long-side people continue to lock up liquid float, remember that volatility can get greater in BOTH directions.  This can mean that you get wiped out if you're somehow still trading GME on margin, as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later.\n* Greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside.  Pre-market and after hours trading don't have circuit breakers, so it could get wild during those times too.\n* Also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently.  After the first frustrating day of this happening with GME I made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so I'd have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen.  For those of you on ToS, use it on the 1 minute chart.  Note that the LULD tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day, so you'd have to adjust the parameters (or just keep it in mind).  I use it with the step lines vs the default line.  If price crosses the guard lines then you're getting close--if it crosses the circuit breaker line then you're about to be or already are getting halted.  Here is the code:\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    input TrailingPeriodLength = 5;\n    input CircuitBreakerPercent = 10.0;\n    input GuardMultiplePercent = 70.0;\n    \n    def trlAvg = Average(close, TrailingPeriodLength);\n    \n    plot trailingAverage = trlAvg;\n    \n    plot upperStop = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);\n    plot lowerStop = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);\n    \n    plot upperRail = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);\n    plot lowerRail = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);\n\nAlso, I got a comment in another post telling me to get a job lol.  Actually I have one, so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to post from Monday forward.  As I've mentioned in a few comments on prior posts, I actually am not active on social media normally.  I just created this account to try to help people use this probably once-in-a-lifetime event and the intense interest it's generating to help people learn to become better investors and traders.  I'll try to keep posting, but maybe not as regularly, and probably shorter (which I know some of you will be happy about :)).\n\nHope you all have a good rest of the weekend.  Good luck in the Market on Monday","html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I&amp;#39;m using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rather than doing a writeup of Friday, I think the time I have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics.  As I mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week, my first glance was that Friday was a low conviction, low volume day where momentum traders/and volatility arbitraging HFT algos were skirmishing, and a slightly deeper look tells me that&amp;#39;s probably the case for almost the entire day, up to the last minutes before close.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain.  Keep in mind also that on Friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with GME, and GME price was also protected from aggressive short-side attack due to the uptick rule.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Capital Flow, Liquid Float, and Price&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, so let&amp;#39;s go with a diagram I put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze.  This is not very formal--just conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price, liquid free float, and capital required to move things around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://u.teknik.io/DDa8Y.PNG\"&gt;Capital Flow to Price Volatility Leverage Conceptual Diagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the diagram, I figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float, moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right, except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold, which moves the fulcrum to the left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lower the liquid free float, or the further to the left the fulcrum goes, the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow (net selling or buying) on share price.  Importantly, as the diagrams on the right half show, it&amp;#39;s not a linear relationship.  The closer the liquid free float comes to 0%, the faster the price volatility increases... theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 0%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify.

CVX -4.29% spoke last year about combining the oil giants, according to people familiar with the talks, testing the waters for what could be one of the largest corporate mergers ever.\n\nChevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth and Exxon CEO Darren Woods spoke shortly after the coronavirus pandemic took hold, decimating oil and gas demand and putting enormous financial strain on both companies, the people said. The discussions were described as preliminary and aren’t ongoing but could come back in the future, the people said.\n\nSuch a deal would reunite the two largest descendants of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly, which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911, and reshape the oil industry.\n\nA combined company’s market value could top $350 billion. Exxon has a market value of $190 billion, while Chevron’s is $164 billion. Together, they would likely form the world’s second largest oil company by market capitalization and production, producing about 7 million barrels of oil and gas a day, based on pre-pandemic levels, second only in both measures to Saudi Aramco.\n\nBut a merger of the two largest American oil companies could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. President Biden has said climate change is one of the biggest crises the country faces. In October, he said he would push the country to “transition away from the oil industry.” He hasn’t been as vocal about antitrust matters, and the administration has yet to nominate the Justice Department’s head of that division.\n\nOne of the people familiar with the talks said the sides may have missed an opportunity to consummate the deal under former President Donald Trump, whose administration was seen as more friendly to the industry.\n\nA handful of sizable oil and gas deals were completed last year, including Chevron’s $5 billion takeover of Noble Energy Inc. and ConocoPhillips ’ roughly $10 billion takeover of Concho Resources Inc., but nothing close to the scale of combining San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron and Irving, Texas-based Exxon.\n\nSuch a deal would be noteworthy in the oil industry, surpassing in size the mega-oil-mergers of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which included the combination of Exxon and Mobil and Chevron and Texaco Inc.\n\nIt also could be the largest corporate tie-up ever, depending on its structure. That distinction currently belongs to the roughly $181 billion purchase of German conglomerate Mannesmann AG by Vodafone AirTouch Plc in 2000, according to Dealogic.\n\nMany investors, analysts and energy executives have called for consolidation in the beleaguered oil-and-gas industry, arguing that cutting costs and improving operational efficiencies would help companies weather the pandemic-induced downturn and prepare for an uncertain future as many countries seek to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels to combat climate change.\n\nIn an interview discussing Chevron’s earnings Friday, Mr. Wirth, who like Mr. Woods also serves as his company’s board chairman, said that consolidation could make the industry more efficient. He was speaking generally and not about a possible Exxon-Chevron merger.\n\n“As for larger scale things, it’s happened before,” Mr. Wirth said, referring to the 1990s and early-2000s megamergers. “Time will tell.”\n\nPaul Sankey, an independent analyst who hypothesized a merger of Chevron and Exxon in October, estimated at the time that the combined company would have a market capitalization of about $300 billion and $100 billion in debt. A merger would allow them to cut a combined $15 billion in administrative expenses and $10 billion in annual capital expenditures, he wrote.\n\nExxon was America’s most valuable company seven years ago, with a market value of more than $400 billion, nearly double Chevron’s. But Exxon has fallen from its heights following a series of strategic missteps, which were further exacerbated by the pandemic. It has been eclipsed as a profit engine by tech giants such as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. in recent years and was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year for the first time since it was added as Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1928.\n\nExxon’s shares have fallen nearly 29% over the last year, while Chevron’s are down about 20%. Chevron briefly topped Exxon in market capitalization in the fall.\n\nExxon endured one of its worst financial performances ever in 2020. It is expected to report a fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the first time in modern history on Tuesday and already has posted more than $2 billion in losses through the first three quarters of 2020.\n\nChevron also has struggled, reporting nearly $5.5 billion in 2020 losses Friday. But investors have expressed more faith in Chevron because it entered the downturn with a stronger balance sheet—in part because it failed in its $33 billion bid to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. before the pandemic, having been outbid by Occidental Petroleum Corp. in 2019.\n\nExxon has about $69 billion in debt as of September, while Chevron has around $35 billion, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nSome investors have grown increasingly concerned about Exxon’s direction under Mr. Woods as the company faces a rapidly changing energy industry and growing global consciousness about climate change. Some are also worried that Exxon may have to cut its hefty dividend, which costs it about $15 billion annually, due to its high debt levels. Many individual investors count on the payments as a source of income.\n\nMr. Woods embarked on an ambitious plan in 2018 to spend $230 billion to pump an additional one million barrels of oil and gas a day by 2025. But before the pandemic, production was up only slightly and Exxon’s financial flexibility was diminished. In November, Exxon retreated from the plan and said it would cut billions of dollars from its capital spending every year through 2025 and focus on investing in only the most promising assets.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s woes have helped draw the attention of activist investors. One of them, Engine No. 1 LLC, has argued that the company should focus more on investments in clean energy while cutting costs elsewhere to preserve its dividend. The firm nominated four directors to Exxon’s board Wednesday and called for it to make strategic changes to its business plan.\n\nExxon also has been in talks with another activist, D.E. Shaw Group, and is preparing to announce one or more new board members, additional spending cuts and investments in new technologies to help it reduce its carbon emissions.\n\nRivals such as BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have embarked on bold strategies to remake their business as regulatory and investor pressure to reduce carbon emissions mounts. Both have said they will invest heavily in renewable energy—a strategy that their investors so far haven’t rewarded.\n\nExxon and Chevron haven’t invested substantially in renewables, instead choosing to double down on oil and gas. Both companies have argued that the world will need vast amounts of fossil fuels for decades to come, and that they can capitalize on current underinvestment in oil production.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/exxon-chevron-ceos-discussed-merger-11612126203?mod=hp_lead_pos1","html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story could definitely have wide ranging impacts within the O&amp;amp;G sector - should be interesting to see how it unfolds:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chief executives of Exxon XOM -2.65% Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp.

Sometimes it feels like you are all alone with owning this stock. And it would be nice to have some discussion about the company, and to hear other investors' views on the stock and the company. Which, in my opinion, is not necessarily the same thing. The company is doing very well, but what about the share? Nothing!! Why?\n\nIt is very difficult for me to understand that we are still at these low levels!\nWhen the oil price has recovered to over $50 and stands at $57/brent at the time of writing. We should get up to the levels we had at the end of 2019 and start in 2020!! To begin with…\n\n”So only there is a nice rise for the stock!”\n\nCertainly the oil price was higher then between 60-65$ barrel. \nBut then there was also uncertainty surrounding krg's payments, which were not paid between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of $41.7 million. Which we will probably soon see start being paid back. At least if we are to believe in Genel, GKP and Dana Gas who have notified the market of this.\n\nBelow I have gathered a few things that make me look bright on the future and that the stock feels interesting to own.\n\n\nRefund from KGR\n\nThat we see  KRG begins repayment of the debt for delivered oil between Nov-19 and Feb-20 of 41.7 million dollars. If we get this money into the bank, it looks very good for the valuation and cash flow!\n\nhttps://genelenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Genel-Resumption-of-override-payments-FINAL-11.12.20.pdf \n\nhttps://www.danagas.com/media/press-releases#sec-5986 \n\nhttps://polaris.brighterir.com/public/gulf_keystone_petroleum/news/rns/story/w6qe47r  \n\nWhy doesn't SNM do the same? And why don't they answer the question of refunds and give feedback to the market when I ask them? Is this in Taqa or what is it that is taking so long? Here I see the closest trigger for the stock! So it's very frustrating that they don't communicate this course-driven information to the market! \n\nI think they can be much better at communicating to the market, what the stock needs are new buyers and higher turnover to attract interest from larger investors. Which is an absolute prerequisite for an higher valuation of the company. Here, the company management needs to become much more active in its actions regarding marketing the company. Why don't they do more to be seen?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncrease in Company Gross 2P Reserves\n\nWe should expect an update before February is over. There can certainly be positive surprises here. What is interesting is our reserves in relation to our production and what has been communicated around development plans for the field.

No, I don't think so. More oil will be transferred to 2P/C but the question is how much and when it will happen? \n\nHow much oil is there in Atrush? I believe in a lot of oil...\n\n\n\nKRG and Baghdad\nWill we finally see a solution between KRG and Baghdad on the budget? And what will it mean for IOCs operating in KRG if SOMO receives 250 bpd, will Baghdad see the contracts as legal? And how will investors view the companies operating in Kurdistan?

According to Bloomberg, Total believes it can get up to $ 500 million for its part. And if they get close to that price, that would be very positive, for the valuation of nearby Atrush! And who could be the buyer? I think that the Russian companies in particular is strengthening its presence in the area. But time will tell. \n\nwww.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/total-said-to-be-in-talks-to-sell-stake-in-kurdistan-oil-field   \n\n\nPlan for expansion\n\nIt will be very interesting to see if there are any decisions, about expanding the field to 80-100bopd. This was to be decided on, in 2020 but was put on hold when Covid-19 became a fact and the oil price crashed. But now it's time I think to make a decision on the issue regarding the future expansion of the field. \n\nPage 3. www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5158/2019-12-snm-cp.pdf \n\nHere I see the greatest potential for an upgrade of the company. Here, future company value and future belief regarding Atrush's ability to be the company's basis for stability and sole asset are determined. I would like to see the use of cash flow to acquire new assets. And that the company can grow further with higher share prices as a result! \n\n\n\n\n\n”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility\"\n\nI think it is very interesting to look back at information that the company has given before. To create an image of where they are today or in the near future. If you look at the presentation from August. \n\nPage 8 www.shamaranpetroleum.com/site/assets/files/5196/corporate_presentation-shamaran-rev10.pdf \n\nSo it will be very interesting regarding the opportunity to see an increase of production in the very near future. Wonder how far the company has come?\n\n”Installation of Second Trainat Early Production Facility. Second productiontrain (EPF.T2) brings current Atrush processing capacity in line with well capacity circa 58Mbopd.” \n\nIs it already installed and they can easily screw up prod 10,000 barrels / day? There is a lot that justifies this, among other things, if you get the debt back from Nov-Feb faster. That calculation becomes much more appealing if you count on 55$ barrels/brent, which we are a bit over now at the time of writing, and a production of 58,000 barrels / day. I do not see it as completely unlikely that in the foreseeable future we will hear from the company that they will increase production to these levels. This is, after all, information from August and it is quite reasonable that we are there today.\n\n\nConditions for earning. As everyone knows, the price of oil is very important. And here I think we will see a surprisingly large re-inhibition of the prize in 2021. What happens to the oil price is always uncertain as it can change overnight both up and down. But there is much to suggest a strong recovery in demand. And this, at the same time as investment in the sector has been declining for several years. This could be a perfect storm for oil prices if supply cannot meet demand. Shamaran produces at a very low cost and here there is an incredible leverage with a higher oil price.\nwww.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-publications/4009-art-berman-macrovoices-jan-7-2021/file\nAnd for every dollar that the oil price increases by, the higher the earnings for snm.

The fact that literally, NO ONE I've seen is talking about this indicates to me that I have to be wrong. But every way I look at it I come to the same conclusion. I'm really new to the investing game, but I have known about how financial markets and how the systems around them work since I was a kid though as my father is a trader for an oil company. So I'm not a complete idiot at least. A lot of this is parroted from other sources, some of which are even from reddit, though I have lost the posts I pulled from so I can't cite them. But I'm not INTENTIONALLY plagiarizing at least. I've posted about this in the wallstreetbets community but they are both idiots and so focused on the GME yolo train that they don't seem interested in anything else. I really hope that someone here can look at my analysis and point out where I'm wrong. So by reading and commenting you are doing me a huge favor so I appreciate it. I'm going to drop the TL;DR at the top and my evidence below.\n\nTL;DR The behavior of the Federal Reserve (the Fed) of the last 20 years has created a market bubble with the value of the US Dollar. Their policies are based around constant and accelerating growth of GDP that is not a realistic goal from a practical perspective as even if there was the possibility of this there is always forces outside the market that affect GDP growth. (Such as a pandemic) As a result, the value of money in the economy is far far greater than the value of the actual dollars that exist. This has created a massive, if yet unseen, bubble that is bound to burst eventually with no real way for the Fed or the government to do anything about it. My expectation is that when this GME rocket goes off in the mother of all short squeezes we will see MASSIVE de-grossing and as a result a steep fall in the value of the stock market over all. Which will in turn cause a run on the banks just like what happened in the depression. When that happens the system will come completely unglued as since not only is there not enough cash on hand to give everyone, the debt backed by that money will no longer be collateralized so everyone is going to come knocking for their money. This sudden evaporation of \"money\" in the economy that's generated by debt will cascade and drive the value of the dollar to at or near 0. Triggering a global economic collapse.\n\nThe behavior of the Fed in the last 20ish years has been to progressively reduce the interest rate that they will loan money to banks to cover their minimum cash on hand amounts by law. This functionally increases the liquidity and availability of money in the form of debt as it allows the banks to make increasingly large amounts of loans for a profit. There's more going on under the hood than just the interest rate but it's historically the primary way that the Fed manages inflation and money supply. \n\nThe Fed can't make large changes to the interest rate because to do so would not only shake confidence in the system but trigger amplification of the inflation/deflation effects on GDP, which in turn can further reduce the GDP due to decreased confidence by those with money to invest. You also don’t want to suddenly massively increase your money supply because this will amplify any effects increased money velocity has on inflation. Increased inflation will also lead to less savings and more people spending money as soon as they receive it. So gradually over time the Fed has decreased the interest rates to the point whereas of March last year they were effectively 0.\n\nThere is massive wealth inequality in the united states. This is not any new information to anyone. But why this matters is that a wealthy individual is far more likely to invest any money they get either through legitimate gains or through increased money supply by the fed than a \"regular\" person would be. This in turn makes it to where rather than circulating back into the economy as regular purchases of conventional goods like bread, milk, cheese, gas. etc. this money goes into investments such as the stock market. This is where the velocity of money comes into play. In short, the \"velocity\" of money is the rate at which it changes hands, usually due to the purchase and sale of real goods. Over the last 20 years the velocity of money has gone down dramatically as the wealth gap gets bigger and bigger.\n\nThe decreased interest rate has added more and more money into the economy through loans/debt. The new money supply, through loans, would be mostly issued for consumption, like a mortgage to buy a new house or a new car loan to buy a car. This will have the added benefit of increasing the velocity of money because this new money supply is recycled into the economy. After 2008, the Fed had to find a new mechanism, with interest rates being permanently too close to zero to have any meaningful impact on the money supply to actually help anything, especially since most Fed board members think that negative interest rates are a bad idea. With quantitative easing, direct purchases of treasuries artificially lowers the yields of treasuries and makes bonds and equities relatively more attractive when looking at risk / reward, inflating prices of those securities. We’ve effectively reached 0% yield on the risk-free-rate during the last crisis, so the next logical step for the Fed was to buy other securities, like commercial paper and now bonds. Except the biggest holders of treasuries and bonds were actually corporations and high-net-worth individuals, who compared to regular people have a much lower propensity to consume, and would not at all address the lowering velocity of money. It also leads towards higher wealth inequality, as it inflates prices of those securities, and all other financial assets which are concentrated at the top corporations and individuals, which tends to be bad for velocity of money. In simplified terms, the increase in money supply goes towards the people who already held a lot of wealth. This is probably why we’re seeing a steep drop-off of money velocity after 2008, even after the economy has recovered.\n\nThen you throw a pandemic into this. Suddenly all the variables are changing rapidly with the economic shock of the effects of the disease. This causes a dramatic drop in the velocity of money. At the same time we're having the biggest sudden drop in GDP in history, at the scale of the Great Depression. The positive feedback loops mean that if the Fed is not able to expand the supply of money enough, we’ll quickly see a deflationary spiral. If they do too much, we quickly get into hyperinflation. The Fed has pretty much maxed out on everything they could have possibly done to keep inflation at 2% by increasing the money supply using tools they’re allowed to use. Interest rates and the risk free rate have been near 0% since 2008, and bond yields are already at unrealistic levels for the amount of risk they have, resulting in a skyrocketing increase in equities. Since none of these actually address the velocity of money issue, which has sharply decreased since March, we’re probably going to head towards a deflationary spiral.\n\nThis has lead to a situation where the true \"value\" of the money in the banks is way different than the value of the debt loaned out to the various parties buying assets in an effort to get greater returns on their investment than they would if they took a \"risk free\" stance. Hence the bubble. To put it another way, for every 1 \"real\" dollar in the banks there are many more dollars circulating in the economy/stock market due to collective debt and risk management.\n\nThe \"risk free\" investment of treasury bond's rate of return has reached effectively 0. So everyone is dumping their bonds, some of which aren’t even getting any bids when being sold, even briefly going into negative territory. Add on the fact that a substantial amount of non-US debt is denominated in US dollars, meaning governments and corporations around the world are trying to get their hands on USD to cover their debt payments with reduced revenue. The skyrocketing corporate bond yields make it virtually impossible for companies, even the ones with strong balance sheets, to raise their much-needed cash to survive through bond issuance.\n\nHow much longer can this last? Fed funds rates are already effectively stuck near zero; even in the “booming” economy that we’ve had the past decade the Fed was barely able to raise the repo rate past 2% before the stock market started crashing in late 2018 and was never able to meaningfully unwind their balance sheet from all the quantitative easing they did in the Great Recession. Now they’ve put their liquidity injection program on steroids with infinite QE. They’ve reduced the risk of corporate bonds by saying they will be the bag holder if things go bad.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that increased liquidity from the Fed causes inflation of asset prices. And at the moment we are at or near maximum liquidity in the economy due to the gradually changing economic policies by the Fed. In an effort to maintain constant \"growth\" of the economy during the financial recessions of 2008 and now 2020 the Fed has made the bar for banks ability to loan money (that they don't actually have mind you as they are using debt to do so) so low that with the effective 0% interest rate they can loan out as much as they want since they can just buy the reserve cash they are required to by law for a rate FAR lower than they can get the buyer of the loan to pay.\n\nAll of this has made the value of the single dollar in the bank is far less than the value it produces in the economy. Remember the bubble part from earlier? Well this is that but on a massive unprecedented scale. Now this could continue for a while and inflation will continue, but the velocity of money will continue to go down and the wealth gap will continue to increase. This increased gap in wealth has made it to where a greater and greater percentage of wealth is in the hands of investment groups like hedge funds which themselves operate off of taking both long and short positions to \"hedge\" their risk, which is thereby rewarded by increased ability to buy due to the confidence the banks/investors have in the hedge funds. So if you as a hedge fund have 1 dollar and your creditor gives you access to 10 dollars for your long positions as long as you promise to take a 10 dollar short position as well. This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk, but in reality your 1 dollar is exposed to 20 dollars worth of risk.\n\nThen comes along wallstreetbets. They notice the massive overshorting of GME stock. They take this opportunity to trigger the mother of all short squeezes to spike the price of the GME stock and sell at the top for huge gains. In other words, as the meme stocks like GME go up the highly leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. This is called grossing / de-grossing and as a result of this massive sell off of other assets, be it stocks, bonds, commodities, what have you. Cause the price to drop. You can see this in the effect the GME thing has had on the overall stock market just last week. What makes this worse is that since the price of the GME stock has risen the financial market sees the short position as increasingly lucrative as once the squeeze is over if they can bear through it they will see great returns. This causes a feedback loop as the GME buyers buy more and more of the shorted stock the price rises, which causes the price of other assets in the stock market to fall. And since the GME stock is so over shorted there is theoretically no limit on how far this could go.\n\nSo when the short squeeze on GME begins there is going to be an unfathomably large amount of de-grossing causing the value of all other assets to hit the floor. Much of the stock market’s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so if GME (and other common shorts) skyrockets the rest of the stock market might collapse around it, triggering a financial crisis.\n\nThis would be very bad obviously. But to make it even worse, when the GME bubble does burst all the wealth that's been put into it basically disappears. If it were just major firms that were getting the gains from this they could conceivably reinvest in the now catastrophically low valued stocks. But as a practical matter this is unfeasible as the time between the GME rocket and the reinvestment the run on the banks will have already happened. Additionally, so many of these shareholders are now low net worth individuals and they are far more likely to \"consume\" such as paying off debt or charitable giving such as we've seen on the WSB subreddit already. The sudden decrease in net value of the stock market will trigger a panic and just like in the great depression a run on the banks. Which the bank obviously can't cover because they have loaned out so much of their money that they don't have even a fraction of the ability to return actual dollar bills to their customers. Making this EVEN WORSE the fact that the debt accrued by the banks is so overvalued when the stock market crashes all their loans become basically worthless so not only do they not have no cash on hand from the run on the bank, they don't have any means to recoup the losses from the loans.\n\nAll this to say, the monetary policy of the Fed for the last 20 years has artificially increased the supply of money without actually printing more money. As a result, the value of the stock market is several times greater than the companies that make it up are actually worth. This is going to see an economic crash not just on the scale of the great depression, but several times greater than that. Plus the \"bubble\" here is not tulips, or mortgage-backed securities, but of the dollar itself. So when this collapse happens the value of the dollar will become basically nothing. As the world's reserve currency this will trigger a worldwide collapse, which will trigger an international run on the banks, which will have their own problems respective to their economies financial policies.\n\nI have NO idea how to stop this. If it weren't GME now, it'd be something else in the future, we're just seeing it now due to the massive acceleration of interest in the GME stock due to wallstreetbets and it's subsequent exposure to the main stream media. There aren't any tools left in the Feds toolbelt to get this under control. Even if the SEC froze all purchase/sales of the GME stock (which would be incredibly unpopular anyway) that would only be a temporary solution as eventually some other stock will see this problem and we'll have to go through it all over again.\n\nThis isn't just bad, this is apocalyptically bad. And that's not hyperbole. It could realistically cause the complete collapse of the global economy. There won't just be bread lines, there will be no bread for ANYONE to have.\n\nMy earlier mentioned trader father believes this will cause essentially what happened in the great depression. But this isn't a great depression. This is potentially the collapse of the entire system. During the depression, the stock market didn't hit zero. Not even close. Additionally, there is no \"gold standard\" to get off of like there was in the depression. ALL of our money is fiat currency and is only backed by our collective faith in the government to continue to exist. But that goes out the window now, no one will believe the government can pull us out of this.\n\nIf you've made it this far and think I'm missing something or have too few brain wrinkles then downvote the shit out of me. But I don't think my analysis here is flawed. I really, truly, and sincerely hope I'm wrong. If what I proposed here goes down it will be unspeakably bad. So seriously, if you have an alternative viewpoint or idea to help solve the problem. I'd LOVE to hear it.\n\nEven if every member of WSB became a millionaire because of sick gains from GME, if that triggers the run on the banks and subsequent devaluation of the USD those millions of dollars might not even buy you more than a handful of tendies.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.","html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello All,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So i&amp;#39;m going to say upfront that I really hope that my analysis here is wrong.

And since the GME stock is so over shorted there is theoretically no limit on how far this could go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when the short squeeze on GME begins there is going to be an unfathomably large amount of de-grossing causing the value of all other assets to hit the floor. Much of the stock market’s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so if GME (and other common shorts) skyrockets the rest of the stock market might collapse around it, triggering a financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would be very bad obviously. But to make it even worse, when the GME bubble does burst all the wealth that&amp;#39;s been put into it basically disappears. If it were just major firms that were getting the gains from this they could conceivably reinvest in the now catastrophically low valued stocks. But as a practical matter this is unfeasible as the time between the GME rocket and the reinvestment the run on the banks will have already happened. Additionally, so many of these shareholders are now low net worth individuals and they are far more likely to &amp;quot;consume&amp;quot; such as paying off debt or charitable giving such as we&amp;#39;ve seen on the WSB subreddit already. The sudden decrease in net value of the stock market will trigger a panic and just like in the great depression a run on the banks. Which the bank obviously can&amp;#39;t cover because they have loaned out so much of their money that they don&amp;#39;t have even a fraction of the ability to return actual dollar bills to their customers. Making this EVEN WORSE the fact that the debt accrued by the banks is so overvalued when the stock market crashes all their loans become basically worthless so not only do they not have no cash on hand from the run on the bank, they don&amp;#39;t have any means to recoup the losses from the loans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All this to say, the monetary policy of the Fed for the last 20 years has artificially increased the supply of money without actually printing more money. As a result, the value of the stock market is several times greater than the companies that make it up are actually worth. This is going to see an economic crash not just on the scale of the great depression, but several times greater than that. Plus the &amp;quot;bubble&amp;quot; here is not tulips, or mortgage-backed securities, but of the dollar itself. So when this collapse happens the value of the dollar will become basically nothing. As the world&amp;#39;s reserve currency this will trigger a worldwide collapse, which will trigger an international run on the banks, which will have their own problems respective to their economies financial policies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have NO idea how to stop this. If it weren&amp;#39;t GME now, it&amp;#39;d be something else in the future, we&amp;#39;re just seeing it now due to the massive acceleration of interest in the GME stock due to wallstreetbets and it&amp;#39;s subsequent exposure to the main stream media. There aren&amp;#39;t any tools left in the Feds toolbelt to get this under control. Even if the SEC froze all purchase/sales of the GME stock (which would be incredibly unpopular anyway) that would only be a temporary solution as eventually some other stock will see this problem and we&amp;#39;ll have to go through it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t just bad, this is apocalyptically bad. And that&amp;#39;s not hyperbole. It could realistically cause the complete collapse of the global economy. There won&amp;#39;t just be bread lines, there will be no bread for ANYONE to have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My earlier mentioned trader father believes this will cause essentially what happened in the great depression. But this isn&amp;#39;t a great depression. This is potentially the collapse of the entire system. During the depression, the stock market didn&amp;#39;t hit zero. Not even close. Additionally, there is no &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; to get off of like there was in the depression. ALL of our money is fiat currency and is only backed by our collective faith in the government to continue to exist. But that goes out the window now, no one will believe the government can pull us out of this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve made it this far and think I&amp;#39;m missing something or have too few brain wrinkles then downvote the shit out of me. But I don&amp;#39;t think my analysis here is flawed. I really, truly, and sincerely hope I&amp;#39;m wrong. If what I proposed here goes down it will be unspeakably bad. So seriously, if you have an alternative viewpoint or idea to help solve the problem. I&amp;#39;d LOVE to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if every member of WSB became a millionaire because of sick gains from GME, if that triggers the run on the banks and subsequent devaluation of the USD those millions of dollars might not even buy you more than a handful of tendies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to my TED talk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Kalfira","ts":1612237476},"la5ci3":{"id":"la5ci3","title":"Time to go long on AMD?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la5ci3/time_to_go_long_on_amd/","text":"I missed last year's incredible bull run in a lot of tech.

Thank you everyone for the positive feedback and discussion! \n\nBottom Line Up Front (BLUF) or TL;DR for the non-military types:\n\nLMT is a good target if you want to literally go to the moon, and my PT is $690.26 in two years (more than 2x from current levels). Justification and some possible trade ideas are listed below, just CTRL-F “Trade Ideas”. I hope you guys enjoy this work and would appreciate any discussion or feedback. I hope to catch you in the comments.\n\nTeam,\n\nWe interrupt today’s regularly scheduled short squeeze coverage to discuss a traditionally boring stock, LMT (Lockheed Martin), with significant upside potential. To be clear, this is NOT a short squeeze target like many reddit posts are keying on. I hope that this piece sparks discussion, but if you are just looking for short squeeze content, all I have to say is BUY, HOLD, and GODSPEED.\n\nThe source of inspiration for me writing this piece is threefold; first, retail investors are winning, and I believe that we will continue to win if we continue to identify opportunities in the market. In my view, the stock market has always been a place for the public to shine a light on areas of innovation that real Americans are excited about and proud to be a part of. Online communities have stolen the loudspeaker from hedge fund managers and returned it to decentralized online democracies that quickly and proudly shift their weight behind ideas they believe in. In GME’s case, it was a blatant smear campaign to destroy a struggling business. I think that we should continue this campaign by identifying opportunities in the market and running with them. It may sound overly idealistic, but if reddit can take on the hedge funds, I non-ironically believe that we can quite literally take good companies researching space technology to the moon. I think LMT may be one of several stocks to help get us there.\n\nSecond, a video where the Secretary of State of Massachusetts argues that internet boards are full of a bunch of unsophisticated, thoughtless traders really ticked me off. This piece is designed to show that ‘the little guy’ is ready to get into the weeds, understand business plans, and outpace analysts that think companies like Tesla are overvalued by comparing them to Toyota. That is a big reason that I settled on an old, large, slow growth company to do a deep-dive on, and try my best to show some of the abysmal predictive analysis major ‘research firms’ do on even some of the most heavily covered stocks. LMT is making moves, and the suits on wall street are 10 steps behind. At the time of writing this piece, Analyst Estimates range from 330-460 (what an insane range).\n\nThird, and most importantly, I am in the US military, and I think that it is fun to go deep into the financials of the defense sector. I think that it helps me understand the long-term growth plans of the DoD, and I think that I attack these deep-dives with a perspective that a lot of these finance-from-day-one cats do not understand. Even if no one ever looks at this work, I think that taking the time to write pieces like this makes me a better Soldier, and I will continue to do it in my spare time when I am feeling inspired. I wrote a piece on Raytheon Technologies (Ticker: RTX) 6 months ago, and I think it was well-received. I was most convicted about RTX in the defense sector, but I have since shifted to believing LMT is the leader in the defense space. I am long both, though. If this inspires anyone else to do similar research on other companies, or sparks discussion in the community, that is just a bonus. Special shout-out to the folks that read more than just the TL;DR, but if you do just read the TL;DR, I love you too!\n\nNow let us get into it:\n\n**Leadership**\n\nI generally like to invest in companies that are led by people that seem to have integrity. Jim Taiclet took the reins at LMT in June of last year. While on active duty, he served as a C-141B Starlifter pilot (a retired LMT Aircraft). After getting out he went to work for the American Tower Corporation (Ticker: AMT). His first day at American Tower was September 10, 2001. The following day, AMT lost 13 employees in the World Trade Center attack. He stayed with the company, despite it being decimated by market uncertainty in the wake of 9/11. He was appointed CEO of the very same company in 2004. Over a 16 year tenure as CEO of AMT the company market cap 20x’d. He left his position as CEO of AMT in March of last year, and the stock stagnated since his departure, currently trading at roughly the same market cap as to when he left.\n\nJim Taiclet was also appointed to be the chairman of the board this week, replacing the previous CEO. Why is it relevant that the CEO came from a massive telecommunications company?\n\nRightfully, Taiclet’s focus for LMT is bringing military technology into the modern era. He wants LMT to be a first mover in the military 5G space, military application of AI space, the… space space, and the hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) space. These areas are revolutionary for the boomer defense sector. We will discuss this in more detail later when we cover the company’s P/E multiple and why it is absolute nonsense.\n\nIt is not a surprise to me that they brought Taiclet on during the pandemic. He led AMT through adversity before, and LMT’s positioning during the pandemic is tremendous relative to the rest of the sector, thanks in large part to some strong strategic moves and good investments by current and past leadership. I think that Taiclet is the right CEO for the job.\n\nIn addition to the new CEO, the new Secretary of Defense, Secretary Lloyd Austin, has strong ties to the defense sector. He was formerly a board member for RTX. He is absolutely above reproach, and a true leader of character, but I bring this up not to suggest that he will inappropriately serve in the best interest of defense contractors, but to suggest that he speaks the language of these companies effectively. I do not anticipate that the current administration poses as significant of a risk to the defense sector as many analysts seem to believe. This will be expanded in the headwinds section below.\n\n**SPACE**\n\nCathie Wood and the ARK Invest team brought a lot of attention to the space sector when the ARKX, The ARK Space Exploration ETF, Form N-1A was officially filed through the SEC. More recently, ARK Invest published their Big Ideas 2021 Annual Report and dedicated an entire 7-page chapter to Orbital Aerospace, a new disruptive innovation platform that the ARK Team is investigating. This may have helped energize wall street to re-look their portfolios and their investments in space technology, but it was certainly not the first catalyst that pushed the defense industry in the direction of winning the *new* space race.\n\nIn June 2018, then President Trump announced at the annual National Space Council that “it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in space. So important. Therefore, I am hereby directing the Department of Defense (DoD) and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a Space Force as the sixth branch of the Armed Forces\". Historically, Department of Defense space assets were under the control of the Air Force. By creating a separate branch of service for the United States Space Force (USSF), the DoD would allocate a Chairman of Space Operations on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and clearly define the budget for space operations dedicated directly to the USSF. At present, this budget is funneled from the USAF’s budget. The process was formalized in December of 2019, and the DoD has appropriated \\~$15B to the USSF in their first full year of existence according to the FY21 budget.\n\nAmong the 77 spacecraft that are controlled by the USSF, 29 of them are Lockheed Martin GPS satellites, 6 of them are Lockheed Martin Space-Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS), and LMT had a hand in creating and/or manufacturing for several of the other USSF efforts. The Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared Missile Warning Satellites (also known as Next-Gen OPIR) were contracted out to both Northrup Grumman (Ticker: NOC) and LMT. LMT’s contract is currently set at $4.9B, NOC’s contract is set at $2.37B.\n\nTangentially related to the discussion of space is the discussion of hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs). HGVs have exoatmospheric and atmospheric implications, but I think that their technology is extremely important to driving margins down for both space exploration and terrestrial point-to-point travel. LMT is leading the charge for military HGV research. They hold contracts with the Navy, Air Force, and Army to develop HGVs and hypersonic precision fires. The priority for HGV technology accelerated significantly when Russia launched their Avangard HGV in December of 2019. Improving the technology for HGVs is a critical next-step in maintaining US hegemony, but also maintaining leadership in both terrestrial and exoatmospheric travel.\n\n**LARGE SCALE COMBAT OPERATIONS (LSCO)**\n\nThe DoD transitioning to Large-Scale Combat Operations (LSCO) as the military’s strategic focus. This is a move away from an emphasis on Counter-Insurgency operations. LSCO requires effective multi-domain operations (MDO), which means effective and integrated strategies regarding land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. To have effective MDO, the DoD is seeking systems that both expand capabilities against peer threats and increase the ability to track enemy units and communicate internally. This requires a modernizing military strategy that relies heavily on air, missile, and sensor modernization. Put simply, the DoD has decided to start preparing for peer or near-peer adversaries (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) rather than insurgencies. For this reason, I believe that increased Chinese and Russian tensions are, unfortunate as it may be, a boon to the defense industry. This is particularly true in the missiles/fires and space industry, as peer-to-peer conflicts are won by leveraging technological advantages.\n\nThere are too many projects to cover in detail, but some important military technologies that LMT is focusing on to support LSCO include directed energy weapons (lasers) to address enemy drone technology, machine learning / artificial intelligence (most applications fall under LMT’s classified budget, but it is easy to imagine the applications of AI in a military context), and 5G to increase battlefield connectivity. These projects are all nested within the DoD’s LSCO strategy, and position LMT as the leader in emergent military tech. NOC is the other major contractor making a heavy push in the modernization direction, but winners win, and I think a better CEO, balance sheet, and larger market cap make LMT the clear winner for aiding the DoD in a transition toward LSCO.\n\n**SECTOR COMPARISON (BACKLOG)**\n\nThe discussion of LSCO transitions well into the discussion of defense contractor backlogs. Massive defense contracts are not filled overnight, so examining order backlogs is a relatively reliable way to gauge the interest of the DoD in a defense contractor’s existing or emerging products. For my sector comparison, I am using the top 6 holdings of the iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp; Defense ETF (Ticker: ITA). I hate this ETF, and ETFs like it (DFEN) because of their massively outsized exposure to aerospace, and undersized allocation to companies like LMT. LMT is only 18% smaller than Boeing (Ticker: BA) but is only 30.4% of the exposure of BA (18.46% of the fund is BA, only 5.62% of the fund is LMT). Funds of this category are just BA / RTX hacks. I suggest building your own pie on a site like M1 Finance (although they are implicated in the trade restriction BS… please be advised of that… hoping other brokerages that are above board will offer similar UIs like the pie design… just wanted to be clear there) if you are interested in the defense sector.\n\nThe top 6 holdings of ITA are:\n\nBoeing Company (Ticker: BA, MKT CAP $110B) at 18.46%\n\nRaytheon Technologies (Ticker: RTX, MKT CAP $101B) at 17.84%\n\nLockheed Martin (Ticker: LMT, MKT CAP $90B) at 5.62%\n\nGeneral Dynamics Corporation (Ticker: GD, MKT CAP $42B) 4.78%\n\nTeledyne Technologies Incorporated (Ticker: TDY, MKT CAP $13B) at 4.74%\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (Ticker: NOC, MKT CAP $48B) at 4.64%\n\nAs a brief aside, please look at the breakdowns of ETFs before buying them. The fact that ITA has more exposure to TDY than NOC and L3Harris is wild. Make sector ETFs balanced how you want them to be balanced and it will be more engaging, and you will likely outperform. I digress.\n\nBacklogs for defense companies can easily be pulled from their quarterly reports. Here are the current backlogs in the same order as before, followed by a percentage of their backlog to their current market cap. All numbers are pulled from January earning reports unless otherwise noted with an \\* because they are still pending.\n\n**Boeing Company** backlog (Commercial: $282B, Defense: $61B, Foreign Military Sales (FMS, categorized by BA as ‘Global’): 21B, Total Backlog 364B): BA’s backlog to market cap is a ratio of 3.32, which is strong, but most of that backlog comes from the commercial, not the defense side. Airlines have been getting decimated, I am personally not interested in having much of my backlog exposed to commercial pressures when trying to invest in a defense play. Without commercial exposure, their defense only backlog ratio is .748. This is extremely low. I understand that this does not do BA justice, but I am keying in on defense exposure, and I am left thoroughly unsatisfied by that ratio. Also, we have seen several canceled contracts already on the commercial side.\n\n**Raytheon Technologies** backlog (Defense backlog for all 4 subdivisions: 67.3B): Raytheon only published a defense backlog in this quarter’s report. That is further evidence to me that the commercial aerospace side of the house is getting hammered. They have a relatively week backlog to market cap as well, putting them at a ratio of .664, worse off than the BA defense backlog.\n\n**Lockheed Martin** backlog (Total Backlog: $147B): This backlog blows our first two defense backlogs out of the water with a current market cap to backlog ratio of 1.63.\n\n**General Dynamics Corporation** backlog (Total Backlog: $89.5B, $11.6B is primarily business jets, but it is difficult to determine how much of their aerospace business is commercial): Solid 2.13 ratio, still great 1.85 if you do not consider their aerospace business. The curveball here for me is that GD published a consolidated operating profit of $4.1B including commercial aerospace, whereas LMT published a consolidated operating profit of $9.1B. This makes the LMT ratio of profit/market cap slightly in favor of LMT without accounting for the GD commercial aerospace exposure. This research surprised me; I may like GD more than I originally assumed I would. Still prefer LMT.\n\n**Teledyne Technologies Incorporated** backlog (Found in the earnings transcript, $1.7B): This stock is not quite in the same league as the other major contractors. This is an odd curveball that a lot of the defense ETFs seem to have too much exposure to. They have a weak backlog, but they are a smaller growing company. I am not interested in this at all. It has a backlog ratio of .129.\n\n**Northrop Grumman Corporation** backlog ($81B): Strong numbers here. I see NOC and LMT as the two front-runners in the defense sector. I like LMT more because I like their exposure to AI, 5G, and HGVs more than NOC, but I think this is a great alternative to LMT if you like the defense sector. Has a ratio of 1.69, slightly edging out LMT on this metric. LMT edges out NOC on margins by \\~.9%, though, which has significant implications when considering the depth of the LMT backlog.\n\nThe winners here are LMT, GD, and NOC. BA is attractive if you think anyone will have enough money to buy new planes. BA and RTX are both getting hammered by commercial aerospace exposure right now and are much more positioned as recovery plays. That said, LMT and NOC both make money now, and will regardless of the impact of the pandemic. LMT is growing at a slightly faster rate than NOC. Both are profit machines, but I like LMT’s product portfolio and leadership a lot more.\n\n**FREE CASH FLOW**\n\nDespite the pandemic, LMT had the free cash flow to be able to pay a $2.60 per share dividend. This maintains their \\~3% yearly dividend rate. They had a free cash flow of $6.4B. They spent $3.9 of that in share repurchases and dividend payouts. That leaves 40% of that cash to continue to strengthen one of the most stalwart balance sheets outside of big tech on the street. Having this free cash flow allowed them to purchase Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4B in December. They seem flexible and willing to expand and take advantage of their relative position during the pandemic. This is a stock that has little downside risk and significant upside potential. It is always reassuring to me to know that at the end of the day, a company is using its profit to continue to grow.\n\n**HEADWINDS**\n\n**New Administration** – This is more of an unknown than a headwind. The Obama Administration was not light on military spending, and the newly appointed SecDef is unlikely to shy away from modernizing the force. Military defense budgets may get lost in the political shuffle, but nothing right now suggests that defense budgets are on the chopping block.\n\n**Macroeconomic pressure** – The markets are tumultuous in the wake of GME. Hedgies are shaking in their boots, and scared money weighed on markets the past week. If scared money continues to exert pressure on the broader equity markets, all boomer stocks are likely weighed down by slumping markets.\n\n**Non-meme Status** – The stocks that are impervious to macroeconomic pressures in the above paragraph are the stonks that we, the people, have decided to support. From GME to IPOE, there is a slew of stonks that are watching and laughing from the green zone as the broader markets slip deeper into the red zone. Unless sentiment about LMT changes, I see no evidence that LMT will remain unaffected by a broader economic downturn (despite showing growth YoY during a pandemic).\n\n**TAILWINDS**\n\n**Aerojet Rocketdyne to the Moon** – Cathie Wood opened up a $39mil position in LMT a few weeks ago, and this was near the announcement of ARKX. The big ideas 2021 article focuses heavily on satellite technology, deep learning, and HGVs. I think that the AR acquisition suggests that vertical integration is a priority for LMT. They even fielded a question in their earnings call about whether they were concerned about being perceived as a monopoly. Their answer was spot on—the USFG and DoD have a vested interest in the success of defense companies. Why would they discourage a defense contractor from vertical integration to optimize margins?\n\n**International Tensions** – SolarWinds has escalated US-Russia tensions. President Biden wants to look tough on China. LSCO is a DoD-wide priority.\n\n**5G.Mil** – We still do not have a lot of fidelity on what this looks like, but the military would benefit in a lot of ways if we had world-wide access to the rapid transfer of encrypted data. Many units still rely on Vietnam-era technology signal technology with abysmal data rates. There are a lot of implications if the code can be cracked to win a DoD 5G contract.\n\n**TRADE IDEAS**\n\n**Price Target:** LMT is currently at a P/E of \\~14. Verizon has roughly the same. LMT’s 5-year P/E ratio average is \\~17. NOC is currently at a P/E of \\~20. TSLA has a P/E Ratio of 1339 (disappointingly not 1337). P/E is a useless metric because no one seems to care about it. My point is that LMT makes a lot of money, and other companies that are valued at much higher multiples do not make any money at all. LMT’s P/E ratio is that of a boomer stock that has no growth potential. LMT’s P/E is exactly in line with the Aerospace and Defense Industry P/E ratio standard. LMT’s new CEO is pushing the industry in a new direction. I will arbitrarily choose a P/E ratio of 30, because it is half of the software industry average, and it is a nice round number. Plus, stock values are speculative and nonsense anyway.\n\nShare price today: $321.82\n\nShare price based on LMT average 5-year P/E: $384.08 (I see this as a short term PT, reversion to the mean)\n\nShare price with a P/E of 30: $690.26\n\n**Buy and Hold:** Simple. Doesn’t take much thought. Come back in a year or two and be happy with your tendies (and a few dividends to boot).\n\n**LEAPS Call Debit Spread (Based on last trade prices):** Buy $375 C 20 JAN 23 for $26.5, Sell $450 C 20 JAN 23 for $12. Total Cost $14.5 for a spread width of $75. Max gain 517% per spread. Higher risk strategy.\n\n**LEAPS**: Buy $500 C 20 JAN 23 for $7.20. Very high-risk strat. If the price target is hit within two years, these would be in the money $183 per contract for a gain of 2500%. This is the casino strat.\n\n**SOURCES**\n\n[https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2020/james-taiclet-from-military-pilot-to-successful-ceo.html](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2020/james-taiclet-from-military-pilot-to-successful-ceo.html)\n\n[https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/in-response-to-senator-warrens-questions-secretary-of-defense-nominee-general-lloyd-austin-commits-to-recusing-himself-from-raytheon-decisions-for-four-years](https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/in-response-to-senator-warrens-questions-secretary-of-defense-nominee-general-lloyd-austin-commits-to-recusing-himself-from-raytheon-decisions-for-four-years)\n\n[https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2019-08-30-Lockheed-Martins-Expertise-in-Hypersonic-Flight-Wins-New-Army-Work](https://news.lockheedmartin.com/2019-08-30-Lockheed-Martins-Expertise-in-Hypersonic-Flight-Wins-New-Army-Work)\n\n[https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/hypersonics.html](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/hypersonics.html)\n\n[https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1\\_Download\\_Files\\_ARK-Invest/White\\_Papers/ARK%E2%80%93Invest\\_BigIdeas\\_2021.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4e1a031b-7ed7-4fb2-929c-072267eda5fc%7Cee55057a-bc7b-441e-8b96-452ec1efe34c](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ARK%E2%80%93Invest_BigIdeas_2021.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4e1a031b-7ed7-4fb2-929c-072267eda5fc%7Cee55057a-bc7b-441e-8b96-452ec1efe34c)\n\n[https://www.deseret.com/2018/6/19/20647309/twitter-reacts-to-trump-s-call-for-a-space-force](https://www.deseret.com/2018/6/19/20647309/twitter-reacts-to-trump-s-call-for-a-space-force)\n\n[https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2021/fy2021\\_Budget\\_Request\\_Overview\\_Book.pdf](https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2021/fy2021_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf)\n\n[https://www.airforcemag.com/lockheed-receives-up-to-4-9-billion-for-next-gen-opir-satellites/](https://www.airforcemag.com/lockheed-receives-up-to-4-9-billion-for-next-gen-opir-satellites/)\n\n[https://spacenews.com/northrop-grumman-gets-2-3-billion-space-force-contract-to-develop-missile-warning-satellites/](https://spacenews.com/northrop-grumman-gets-2-3-billion-space-force-contract-to-develop-missile-warning-satellites/)\n\n[https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/directed-energy/laser-weapon-systems.html](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/directed-energy/laser-weapon-systems.html)\n\n[https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/lockheed-martins-ai-applications-for-the-military/](https://emerj.com/ai-sector-overviews/lockheed-martins-ai-applications-for-the-military/)\n\n[https://www.defenseone.com/business/2020/07/new-ceo-wants-lockheed-become-5g-player/167072/](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2020/07/new-ceo-wants-lockheed-become-5g-player/167072/)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/defense-firms-expect-higher-spending-11548783988](https://www.wsj.com/articles/defense-firms-expect-higher-spending-11548783988)\n\n[https://www.etf.com/ITA#efficiency](https://www.etf.com/ITA#efficiency)\n\n[https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/4Q20-Presentation.pdf](https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/4Q20-Presentation.pdf)\n\n[https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/dfd94ff7-4cca-4540-bc4b-4e3ba92fc646](https://investors.rtx.com/static-files/dfd94ff7-4cca-4540-bc4b-4e3ba92fc646)\n\n[https://investors.lockheedmartin.com/static-files/64e5aa03-9023-423a-8908-2aae8c7015ac](https://investors.lockheedmartin.com/static-files/64e5aa03-9023-423a-8908-2aae8c7015ac)\n\n[https://s22.q4cdn.com/891946778/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/GD\\_4Q20\\_Earnings\\_Highlights-Outlook-Final.pdf](https://s22.q4cdn.com/891946778/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/GD_4Q20_Earnings_Highlights-Outlook-Final.pdf)\n\n[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/teledyne-technologies-inc-tdy-q4-2020-earnings-cal/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/teledyne-technologies-inc-tdy-q4-2020-earnings-cal/)\n\n[https://investor.northropgrumman.com/static-files/6e6e117f-f656-4c68-ba7f-3dc53c2dd13a](https://investor.northropgrumman.com/static-files/6e6e117f-f656-4c68-ba7f-3dc53c2dd13a)","html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edit 1: More ARKQ buying today (~50k shares).

To be clear, this is NOT a short squeeze target like many reddit posts are keying on. I hope that this piece sparks discussion, but if you are just looking for short squeeze content, all I have to say is BUY, HOLD, and GODSPEED.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The source of inspiration for me writing this piece is threefold; first, retail investors are winning, and I believe that we will continue to win if we continue to identify opportunities in the market. In my view, the stock market has always been a place for the public to shine a light on areas of innovation that real Americans are excited about and proud to be a part of. Online communities have stolen the loudspeaker from hedge fund managers and returned it to decentralized online democracies that quickly and proudly shift their weight behind ideas they believe in. In GME’s case, it was a blatant smear campaign to destroy a struggling business. I think that we should continue this campaign by identifying opportunities in the market and running with them. It may sound overly idealistic, but if reddit can take on the hedge funds, I non-ironically believe that we can quite literally take good companies researching space technology to the moon. I think LMT may be one of several stocks to help get us there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, a video where the Secretary of State of Massachusetts argues that internet boards are full of a bunch of unsophisticated, thoughtless traders really ticked me off. This piece is designed to show that ‘the little guy’ is ready to get into the weeds, understand business plans, and outpace analysts that think companies like Tesla are overvalued by comparing them to Toyota. That is a big reason that I settled on an old, large, slow growth company to do a deep-dive on, and try my best to show some of the abysmal predictive analysis major ‘research firms’ do on even some of the most heavily covered stocks. LMT is making moves, and the suits on wall street are 10 steps behind. At the time of writing this piece, Analyst Estimates range from 330-460 (what an insane range).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, and most importantly, I am in the US military, and I think that it is fun to go deep into the financials of the defense sector. I think that it helps me understand the long-term growth plans of the DoD, and I think that I attack these deep-dives with a perspective that a lot of these finance-from-day-one cats do not understand. Even if no one ever looks at this work, I think that taking the time to write pieces like this makes me a better Soldier, and I will continue to do it in my spare time when I am feeling inspired. I wrote a piece on Raytheon Technologies (Ticker: RTX) 6 months ago, and I think it was well-received. I was most convicted about RTX in the defense sector, but I have since shifted to believing LMT is the leader in the defense space. I am long both, though. If this inspires anyone else to do similar research on other companies, or sparks discussion in the community, that is just a bonus. Special shout-out to the folks that read more than just the TL;DR, but if you do just read the TL;DR, I love you too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now let us get into it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I generally like to invest in companies that are led by people that seem to have integrity. Jim Taiclet took the reins at LMT in June of last year. While on active duty, he served as a C-141B Starlifter pilot (a retired LMT Aircraft). After getting out he went to work for the American Tower Corporation (Ticker: AMT). His first day at American Tower was September 10, 2001. The following day, AMT lost 13 employees in the World Trade Center attack. He stayed with the company, despite it being decimated by market uncertainty in the wake of 9/11. He was appointed CEO of the very same company in 2004. Over a 16 year tenure as CEO of AMT the company market cap 20x’d. He left his position as CEO of AMT in March of last year, and the stock stagnated since his departure, currently trading at roughly the same market cap as to when he left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jim Taiclet was also appointed to be the chairman of the board this week, replacing the previous CEO. Why is it relevant that the CEO came from a massive telecommunications company?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rightfully, Taiclet’s focus for LMT is bringing military technology into the modern era. He wants LMT to be a first mover in the military 5G space, military application of AI space, the… space space, and the hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) space. These areas are revolutionary for the boomer defense sector. We will discuss this in more detail later when we cover the company’s P/E multiple and why it is absolute nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is not a surprise to me that they brought Taiclet on during the pandemic. He led AMT through adversity before, and LMT’s positioning during the pandemic is tremendous relative to the rest of the sector, thanks in large part to some strong strategic moves and good investments by current and past leadership. I think that Taiclet is the right CEO for the job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to the new CEO, the new Secretary of Defense, Secretary Lloyd Austin, has strong ties to the defense sector. He was formerly a board member for RTX. He is absolutely above reproach, and a true leader of character, but I bring this up not to suggest that he will inappropriately serve in the best interest of defense contractors, but to suggest that he speaks the language of these companies effectively. I do not anticipate that the current administration poses as significant of a risk to the defense sector as many analysts seem to believe. This will be expanded in the headwinds section below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPACE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cathie Wood and the ARK Invest team brought a lot of attention to the space sector when the ARKX, The ARK Space Exploration ETF, Form N-1A was officially filed through the SEC. More recently, ARK Invest published their Big Ideas 2021 Annual Report and dedicated an entire 7-page chapter to Orbital Aerospace, a new disruptive innovation platform that the ARK Team is investigating. This may have helped energize wall street to re-look their portfolios and their investments in space technology, but it was certainly not the first catalyst that pushed the defense industry in the direction of winning the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; space race.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In June 2018, then President Trump announced at the annual National Space Council that “it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space, we must have American dominance in space. So important. Therefore, I am hereby directing the Department of Defense (DoD) and Pentagon to immediately begin the process necessary to establish a Space Force as the sixth branch of the Armed Forces&amp;quot;. Historically, Department of Defense space assets were under the control of the Air Force. By creating a separate branch of service for the United States Space Force (USSF), the DoD would allocate a Chairman of Space Operations on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and clearly define the budget for space operations dedicated directly to the USSF. At present, this budget is funneled from the USAF’s budget. The process was formalized in December of 2019, and the DoD has appropriated ~$15B to the USSF in their first full year of existence according to the FY21 budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Among the 77 spacecraft that are controlled by the USSF, 29 of them are Lockheed Martin GPS satellites, 6 of them are Lockheed Martin Space-Based Infrared Systems (SBIRS), and LMT had a hand in creating and/or manufacturing for several of the other USSF efforts. The Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared Missile Warning Satellites (also known as Next-Gen OPIR) were contracted out to both Northrup Grumman (Ticker: NOC) and LMT. LMT’s contract is currently set at $4.9B, NOC’s contract is set at $2.37B.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tangentially related to the discussion of space is the discussion of hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs). HGVs have exoatmospheric and atmospheric implications, but I think that their technology is extremely important to driving margins down for both space exploration and terrestrial point-to-point travel. LMT is leading the charge for military HGV research. They hold contracts with the Navy, Air Force, and Army to develop HGVs and hypersonic precision fires. The priority for HGV technology accelerated significantly when Russia launched their Avangard HGV in December of 2019. Improving the technology for HGVs is a critical next-step in maintaining US hegemony, but also maintaining leadership in both terrestrial and exoatmospheric travel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LARGE SCALE COMBAT OPERATIONS (LSCO)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The DoD transitioning to Large-Scale Combat Operations (LSCO) as the military’s strategic focus. This is a move away from an emphasis on Counter-Insurgency operations. LSCO requires effective multi-domain operations (MDO), which means effective and integrated strategies regarding land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. To have effective MDO, the DoD is seeking systems that both expand capabilities against peer threats and increase the ability to track enemy units and communicate internally. This requires a modernizing military strategy that relies heavily on air, missile, and sensor modernization. Put simply, the DoD has decided to start preparing for peer or near-peer adversaries (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) rather than insurgencies. For this reason, I believe that increased Chinese and Russian tensions are, unfortunate as it may be, a boon to the defense industry. This is particularly true in the missiles/fires and space industry, as peer-to-peer conflicts are won by leveraging technological advantages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are too many projects to cover in detail, but some important military technologies that LMT is focusing on to support LSCO include directed energy weapons (lasers) to address enemy drone technology, machine learning / artificial intelligence (most applications fall under LMT’s classified budget, but it is easy to imagine the applications of AI in a military context), and 5G to increase battlefield connectivity. These projects are all nested within the DoD’s LSCO strategy, and position LMT as the leader in emergent military tech. NOC is the other major contractor making a heavy push in the modernization direction, but winners win, and I think a better CEO, balance sheet, and larger market cap make LMT the clear winner for aiding the DoD in a transition toward LSCO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SECTOR COMPARISON (BACKLOG)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The discussion of LSCO transitions well into the discussion of defense contractor backlogs. Massive defense contracts are not filled overnight, so examining order backlogs is a relatively reliable way to gauge the interest of the DoD in a defense contractor’s existing or emerging products. For my sector comparison, I am using the top 6 holdings of the iShares U.S. Aerospace &amp;amp; Defense ETF (Ticker: ITA). I hate this ETF, and ETFs like it (DFEN) because of their massively outsized exposure to aerospace, and undersized allocation to companies like LMT. LMT is only 18% smaller than Boeing (Ticker: BA) but is only 30.4% of the exposure of BA (18.46% of the fund is BA, only 5.62% of the fund is LMT). Funds of this category are just BA / RTX hacks. I suggest building your own pie on a site like M1 Finance (although they are implicated in the trade restriction BS… please be advised of that… hoping other brokerages that are above board will offer similar UIs like the pie design… just wanted to be clear there) if you are interested in the defense sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The top 6 holdings of ITA are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boeing Company (Ticker: BA, MKT CAP $110B) at 18.46%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Raytheon Technologies (Ticker: RTX, MKT CAP $101B) at 17.84%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lockheed Martin (Ticker: LMT, MKT CAP $90B) at 5.62%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;General Dynamics Corporation (Ticker: GD, MKT CAP $42B) 4.78%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Teledyne Technologies Incorporated (Ticker: TDY, MKT CAP $13B) at 4.74%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Northrop Grumman Corporation (Ticker: NOC, MKT CAP $48B) at 4.64%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a brief aside, please look at the breakdowns of ETFs before buying them. The fact that ITA has more exposure to TDY than NOC and L3Harris is wild. Make sector ETFs balanced how you want them to be balanced and it will be more engaging, and you will likely outperform. I digress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Backlogs for defense companies can easily be pulled from their quarterly reports. Here are the current backlogs in the same order as before, followed by a percentage of their backlog to their current market cap. All numbers are pulled from January earning reports unless otherwise noted with an * because they are still pending.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boeing Company&lt;/strong&gt; backlog (Commercial: $282B, Defense: $61B, Foreign Military Sales (FMS, categorized by BA as ‘Global’): 21B, Total Backlog 364B): BA’s backlog to market cap is a ratio of 3.32, which is strong, but most of that backlog comes from the commercial, not the defense side. Airlines have been getting decimated, I am personally not interested in having much of my backlog exposed to commercial pressures when trying to invest in a defense play. Without commercial exposure, their defense only backlog ratio is .748. This is extremely low. I understand that this does not do BA justice, but I am keying in on defense exposure, and I am left thoroughly unsatisfied by that ratio. Also, we have seen several canceled contracts already on the commercial side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raytheon Technologies&lt;/strong&gt; backlog (Defense backlog for all 4 subdivisions: 67.3B): Raytheon only published a defense backlog in this quarter’s report. That is further evidence to me that the commercial aerospace side of the house is getting hammered. They have a relatively week backlog to market cap as well, putting them at a ratio of .664, worse off than the BA defense backlog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lockheed Martin&lt;/strong&gt; backlog (Total Backlog: $147B): This backlog blows our first two defense backlogs out of the water with a current market cap to backlog ratio of 1.63.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Dynamics Corporation&lt;/strong&gt; backlog (Total Backlog: $89.5B, $11.6B is primarily business jets, but it is difficult to determine how much of their aerospace business is commercial): Solid 2.13 ratio, still great 1.85 if you do not consider their aerospace business. The curveball here for me is that GD published a consolidated operating profit of $4.1B including commercial aerospace, whereas LMT published a consolidated operating profit of $9.1B. This makes the LMT ratio of profit/market cap slightly in favor of LMT without accounting for the GD commercial aerospace exposure. This research surprised me; I may like GD more than I originally assumed I would. Still prefer LMT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teledyne Technologies Incorporated&lt;/strong&gt; backlog (Found in the earnings transcript, $1.7B): This stock is not quite in the same league as the other major contractors. This is an odd curveball that a lot of the defense ETFs seem to have too much exposure to. They have a weak backlog, but they are a smaller growing company. I am not interested in this at all. It has a backlog ratio of .129.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northrop Grumman Corporation&lt;/strong&gt; backlog ($81B): Strong numbers here. I see NOC and LMT as the two front-runners in the defense sector. I like LMT more because I like their exposure to AI, 5G, and HGVs more than NOC, but I think this is a great alternative to LMT if you like the defense sector. Has a ratio of 1.69, slightly edging out LMT on this metric. LMT edges out NOC on margins by ~.9%, though, which has significant implications when considering the depth of the LMT backlog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The winners here are LMT, GD, and NOC. BA is attractive if you think anyone will have enough money to buy new planes. BA and RTX are both getting hammered by commercial aerospace exposure right now and are much more positioned as recovery plays. That said, LMT and NOC both make money now, and will regardless of the impact of the pandemic. LMT is growing at a slightly faster rate than NOC. Both are profit machines, but I like LMT’s product portfolio and leadership a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FREE CASH FLOW&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the pandemic, LMT had the free cash flow to be able to pay a $2.60 per share dividend. This maintains their ~3% yearly dividend rate. They had a free cash flow of $6.4B. They spent $3.9 of that in share repurchases and dividend payouts. That leaves 40% of that cash to continue to strengthen one of the most stalwart balance sheets outside of big tech on the street. Having this free cash flow allowed them to purchase Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4B in December. They seem flexible and willing to expand and take advantage of their relative position during the pandemic. This is a stock that has little downside risk and significant upside potential. It is always reassuring to me to know that at the end of the day, a company is using its profit to continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HEADWINDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Administration&lt;/strong&gt; – This is more of an unknown than a headwind. The Obama Administration was not light on military spending, and the newly appointed SecDef is unlikely to shy away from modernizing the force. Military defense budgets may get lost in the political shuffle, but nothing right now suggests that defense budgets are on the chopping block.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macroeconomic pressure&lt;/strong&gt; – The markets are tumultuous in the wake of GME. Hedgies are shaking in their boots, and scared money weighed on markets the past week. If scared money continues to exert pressure on the broader equity markets, all boomer stocks are likely weighed down by slumping markets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-meme Status&lt;/strong&gt; – The stocks that are impervious to macroeconomic pressures in the above paragraph are the stonks that we, the people, have decided to support. From GME to IPOE, there is a slew of stonks that are watching and laughing from the green zone as the broader markets slip deeper into the red zone. Unless sentiment about LMT changes, I see no evidence that LMT will remain unaffected by a broader economic downturn (despite showing growth YoY during a pandemic).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAILWINDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerojet Rocketdyne to the Moon&lt;/strong&gt; – Cathie Wood opened up a $39mil position in LMT a few weeks ago, and this was near the announcement of ARKX. The big ideas 2021 article focuses heavily on satellite technology, deep learning, and HGVs. I think that the AR acquisition suggests that vertical integration is a priority for LMT. They even fielded a question in their earnings call about whether they were concerned about being perceived as a monopoly. Their answer was spot on—the USFG and DoD have a vested interest in the success of defense companies. Why would they discourage a defense contractor from vertical integration to optimize margins?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Tensions&lt;/strong&gt; – SolarWinds has escalated US-Russia tensions. President Biden wants to look tough on China. LSCO is a DoD-wide priority.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5G.Mil&lt;/strong&gt; – We still do not have a lot of fidelity on what this looks like, but the military would benefit in a lot of ways if we had world-wide access to the rapid transfer of encrypted data. Many units still rely on Vietnam-era technology signal technology with abysmal data rates. There are a lot of implications if the code can be cracked to win a DoD 5G contract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRADE IDEAS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price Target:&lt;/strong&gt; LMT is currently at a P/E of ~14. Verizon has roughly the same. LMT’s 5-year P/E ratio average is ~17. NOC is currently at a P/E of ~20. TSLA has a P/E Ratio of 1339 (disappointingly not 1337). P/E is a useless metric because no one seems to care about it. My point is that LMT makes a lot of money, and other companies that are valued at much higher multiples do not make any money at all. LMT’s P/E ratio is that of a boomer stock that has no growth potential. LMT’s P/E is exactly in line with the Aerospace and Defense Industry P/E ratio standard. LMT’s new CEO is pushing the industry in a new direction. I will arbitrarily choose a P/E ratio of 30, because it is half of the software industry average, and it is a nice round number. Plus, stock values are speculative and nonsense anyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Share price today: $321.82&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Share price based on LMT average 5-year P/E: $384.08 (I see this as a short term PT, reversion to the mean)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Share price with a P/E of 30: $690.26&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buy and Hold:&lt;/strong&gt; Simple. Doesn’t take much thought. Come back in a year or two and be happy with your tendies (and a few dividends to boot).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEAPS Call Debit Spread (Based on last trade prices):&lt;/strong&gt; Buy $375 C 20 JAN 23 for $26.5, Sell $450 C 20 JAN 23 for $12. Total Cost $14.5 for a spread width of $75. Max gain 517% per spread. Higher risk strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LEAPS&lt;/strong&gt;: Buy $500 C 20 JAN 23 for $7.20. Very high-risk strat. If the price target is hit within two years, these would be in the money $183 per contract for a gain of 2500%. This is the casino strat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOURCES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a

Its Selling/General/Admin and R&amp;D expenses are still growing, but now at a lower rate than its revenue growth. This has helped the company to become operationally profitable, but not yet consistently bottom-line (net income) profitable.\n\nIts Net Retention Rate is also increasing. Up from 116% a year ago to 131%. This is still behind TWLO, which is [at 137%](https://s21.q4cdn.com/963721274/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Q3'20-Earnings-Presentation_FINAL.pdf), but a strong figure nonetheless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.

I think this is fine since BAND’s growth is one of the best in its industry and this growth is accelerating.\n\nI’m using Gross Profit as my main comparison metric for a few reasons. I like that it takes into account the gross margin of the company. BAND has a lower gross margin than TWLO, so it should be penalised for this in the comparison. Using net income doesn’t make much sense since BAND is just missing out on making a profit, so its PE ratio is nonsensically low. The market caps in the software-infrastructure industry are correlated well with gross profit, so as gross profit increases, the market cap should increase in a similar step.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.

Currently, their combined trailing-twelve-month revenue is $1.83B (TWLO: $1.54B; BAND: $292M). TWLO’s market cap is $52B vs $4B for BAND, so there’s plenty of room for it to play catch up.\n\nTWLO offers a wider set of services than BAND, but I see this as more opportunities for the company. If it can continue to offer a lower price and higher quality than TWLO, as it claims it can, then it should be able to remain a strong competitor.\n\nThe reason for keeping half my shares in TWLO was largely a diversification play. BAND looks like good value now and is growing well. TWLO has a long history of growth and a wide product range. Given the size of the market, there’s plenty of room for them both. Since I’m not fully confident that one will outperform the other, I thought it best to own both.  \n\n\nEdit: Expand the introduction.","html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclosure: I bought some shares in BAND a couple of weeks ago by selling half my stake in TWLO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://theportfoliolab.com/summary/BAND\"&gt;BAND&lt;/a&gt; is in the Communication Platform as a Service industry.

While Jeffrey was CEO at Level 3, he completely turned around that company.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major risk factors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nHigh debt level and declining revenue on legacy assets.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why I am long LUMN?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LUMN owns about 450,000 miles of optic fiber and serves 60 countries. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since, becoming CEO in 2018, Jeffrey has drastically improved the balance sheet. LUMN refinanced ~$18 billion to $20 billion in last few years which helped to reduce the interest expense significantly and push debt maturity way in the future. They also started paying down the debt.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Revenue on legacy business is declining but the revenue on rest of the business seems stable and started growing slowly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the current free cash flow - $1/year dividend seems sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;[PS: Please note this is not an investment advise.

The focus is on mining and processing Vanadium. Bushveld is one of the only primary production sites for Vanadium in the world. There is supplies from a limited life mine in Brazil and then in the 'free' world, it is Bushveld. The other places are in Russia and China\n\nVanadium is a critical mineral to the world with its primary use being in hardening steel, a whole bunch of materials and aerospace applications with a large and growing deficit of production vs need, and now ... Electrical Storage in the form of Vanadium Redox Reflow Batteries (VFRB). Power density is lower than Lithium, but so what... it does not catch fire !\n\nJust to be clear - every single gram processed could be sold into Steel production every year forever ... generating growing profits and future dividends..... all the 'other' goodies to do with VFRB Storage just add value and a large and increasing profit\n\nIn 2018 Vanadium pricing peaked and with production rather less than 3,000 tonnes generated an EBITDA of £94M. With reducing Vanadium spot price but increased production the 2019 EBITDA was the same - point is that as production is rapidly rising to knocking 5,000 tonnes this year and 6,400 pretty much over the next 15 months, the sustained profitability is assured\n\nTo put it into a wider perspective, Bushveld is in the top 10 on AIM for NET Profit and in the top 33% of FTSE All Share for NET Profit, around the middle of F350 as well... not bad for an unloved company\n\nCash is king and as the rapid capital growth phase tops out dividends will flow and lots of them.\n\nSo to summarize ..\n\nTwo of the 4 primary Vanadium producing Plants are in South Africa and owned by Bushveld Minerals. All serious industry commentary points to a Vanadium deficit with inventories run low. With the world embarking on an infrastructure spending spree post Covid large amounts of re-enforced steel is required. This coincides with the long awaited development and commissioning of large scale VFRB facilities.\n\nOne of the great hindrances to VFRB has been the high price volatility of vanadium meaning the electrolyte costs (around 30-40% of the whole system) could not be capitalised easily. Now there is Leasing where the capital cost is transferred to Opex of 3, 5 or more years. VFRB plants can now be fully capitalised in a normal way as a physical build, structure and asset value.\n\nVertical integration, simply put really means the following:\n\n\\- Ore for processing - Bushveld has vast reserves and the new mining rights at Mokopane\n\n\\- Vanadium for steel - Bushveld Minerals\n\n\\- Electrolyte - Bushveld Energy\n\n\\- Leased electrolyte - VERL (the new rental consortium with Bushveld at the core)\n\n\\- VFRB systems - Invinity &amp; Enerox - Bushveld has a stake and first rights to supply vanadium/electrolyte\n\nAt every stage of the value chain from ore to VFRB system, Bushveld has a big chunk of the action.

A lot more than normal.  And compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here.  So let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose.  Short, long, whatever.  It doesn't matter if you're a 19 year old throwing in your life savings or Bill fucking Ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with Herbalife.  Letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money. \n\nAnd a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this GME, AMC, whatever.\n\nTo the point: I am not making a buy/sell/hold/whatever recommendation.  I have no special insight in to what's happening with GME or whatever else.  What I can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $300.\n\nSo let's dispel one quick thing: this is not David vs Goliath.  It also isn't the little man vs hedge funds or WSB vs big finance.  It might have started out that way, but if you only read one thing [read this](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop): \n\n&gt;Many of the big retail brokerages, including Robinhood, route a lot of their customer orders to Citadel Securities, so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in U.S. stocks. It can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced. You might expect—I certainly expected—to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week. The stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment, and the posters on WallStreetBets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $1,000.\n\n&gt;But here’s what Citadel Securities’ retail flow looked like in GameStop this week: 1\n\n&gt;[Graphic here](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i9SnRzR8AM1c/v0/800x-1.png)\n\n\n&gt;Retail investors were net buyers on Monday but net sellers for the rest of the week (through yesterday), and all in all quite balanced: About 49.8% of retail orders (that Citadel Securities saw) were to buy, and 50.2% were to sell.\n\n&gt;What do you make of that? One reading would be: “Retail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they’re not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.” Or as one Twitter user put it, “past the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.”\n\n\n\nSo, just to be clear about this, there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade, and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker.  \n\n**Understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover**.  \nYou, and everyone else, have no idea what Melvin's position looks like, and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened.  You don't know how hedged they are, you don't know what their collateral looks like, and you don't know if they've covered and restructured a short at last week's prices.  You simply don't know.  You only know what's been presented in the news, which is almost certainly bullshit.  \n\nThis thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you won't know what happened for weeks.  You might go take a shit at 1pm today and come back to GME trading at $16 because Ken Griffin got on CNBC and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $200, and were happy to sit on it.  Make no mistake, you'll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend.    \n\n**Emotions**\nThe problem with this whole \"strike back at wall street\" narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade.  Losing money sucks, but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt.  This isn't a moral crusade to them, it's 25 billion dollars.  So if you're out here putting money and emotions on the line that you can't afford to lose there won't be a happy ending. \n\nWant to fight the good fight against wall street? Write your congressman, Tweet AOC or Ted Cruz, get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet.  But dropping money on GME that you need in life ain't gonna change anything except your net worth.\n\nTLDR: \n\n1) know and understand who is playing this game.  And that they have access to tools, leverage, and markets that you do not.  You're playing Le Chiffre at Casino Royale right now, you might think you're James Bond but there's a good chance that you're just the fat dude in the corner. \n\n2) Short squeezes end fast.  As fast as they started.  If you're new to trading then understand buying GME at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a TikTock about it.\n\n3) Get your emotions out of play here.  This whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes.  Can't handle that?  then maybe it's not a good idea to sit at this table.  \n\nLastly, if you really just can't get yourself out of the whole \"fight the hedge funds\" nonsense, at least understand that you're spending money that you likely won't get back.  If that's worth it to you then have at it.  But don't fool yourself  in to thinking otherwise.\n\n**E: Completely unrelated**: I hate reddit awards, reddit doesn't need your money.

Merger estimate in Feb/ early March.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- They already have over 50% of market share on class 3-7 EV trucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-  Production had already started in 2018, with already 100+ vehicles on  the road, compared to peers HYLN, XL, NKLA, they have ZERO vehicle on  the road, they haven&amp;#39;t even started production yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- FIXED contract for EV fleet orders with Amazon and IKEA, guaranteed revenue already for 2021&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-  FIXED contracts with Ford for shells and fleet electrification and  Romeo Power for batteries, with decreasing cost over the years.  guaranteed revenue already for 2021&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/06/newsom-plan-includes-1point5-billion-to-boost-electric-hydrogen-vehicles.html\"&gt;California will include a $1.5 Billion stimulus package for EV and Hydrogen vehicles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Dems winning senate, EV will continue to go up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a href=\"https://i.redd.it/ouv65gdbkq961.jpg\"&gt;Going on Cramer&amp;#39;s Mad Money soon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 25% of outstanding shares will be for SPAC investors, this is huge - as most SPACs only leave ~10% to retail investors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;GIK has options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IMO, GIK is under the radar because the other Giga SPAC is merging with some garbage (G I X, avoid it). It was also overshadowed by some other catalysts on the market recently. At this price, you have minimum  downside. This will run like XL, but better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I expect this to run high in FEB when it gets  closer to merger. However, it is difficult to time EV SPACs. The next  major catalysts would be: Cramer show appearance, Merger Vote date announcement, Actual Merger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lightning eMotors merging with GigaCapital3  (Ticker: &lt;strong&gt;GIK&lt;/strong&gt;) - PT $20+.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Positions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GIK - 200 Commons, 300 Warrants&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Igettheshow89","ts":1612280862},"layaah":{"id":"layaah","title":"Long NOK wondering about 8% drop in price today (especially with earnings to be released this week)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/layaah/long_nok_wondering_about_8_drop_in_price_today/","text":"Hi everyone, been wondering about this for some time now.

The stock traded as high as $51.37, and has traded between $35 and $45 for some weeks.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\n\\-Relatively small market cap (3.43 Billion)\n\n\\- Earning's release for Q4: Feb 9th.\n\n\\- Announced release of new product (solid state drives) on Jan 28th\n\n\\- Expected earnings were recently adjusted, higher:\n\nNet revenue: $1,651 million to $1,666 million.\n\n* Operating income: $186 million to $192 million.\n* EBITDA: $194 million to $200 million.\n\n\\- Tied for first place in the 'computer hardware' category, alongside Logitech\n\n\\- Last quarter Corsair reported a 100% earnings surprise (0.52 vs 0.26 earnings per share)\n\n\\- Lockup period for sale of insider shares expires late March, though the recent announcement to sell non-diluted shares direct to institutions at $35 is promising.\n\nChristmas sales will likely be focused around peripherals, like head phones and streaming gear.\n\nA number of Corsair execs announced they will be selling shares direct, ie. will not dilute common shares, direct to institutional investors at $35 per share. This will, hopefully, reduce volatility in the stock, as there is relatively little available for trade, most of it being locked up with execs and institutional owners. It should also set a floor on near term pricing.\n\nAnalyst currently give the company a 'Buy' and 'Strong Buy' rating.\n\nTLDR: buy CRSR.\n\nEarnings date: February 9th.\n\nAll time high: $52.37\n\nCurrent: $38.13\n\nEdit: For people asking about the dip a few weeks ago and for those concerned about the announcement of non-diluted share offering at $35, here is my two cents: There are a lot of reasons for a company to issue shares: to raise money, to decrease volatility, to enrich themselves. That Corsair's execs have decided to sell some of their own shares at $35, is in my mind, a better alternative as it will not necessarily dilute the value of existing stock and it puts it out 'on the market', even if these institutional investors are unlikely to trade these often. This sale could mean the execs think it's not going to $50, but its just as likely they see $35 as a good price, attractive to both them and institutional investors, and they want to both take some money off the table , while simultaneously decreasing the volatility of the stock. The fact that the stock was $38 when they announced this, and that most investors bought in at $12 when CRSR IPO'd 6 months ago, is actually fairly bullish, to my mind. It basically indicates that institutional investors think CRSR is worth more than twice what they paid for it.

They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.\n\nThe share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.\n\nPros :\n\n1. Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google,  Stratasys and the likes.\n\n2. Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.\n\n3. They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.\n\n4. Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.\n\n5. The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.\n\n6. It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.\n\n7. Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.\n\n8. It's 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods.\n\n9. They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.\n\nCons :\n\n1. The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.\n\n2. Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc\n\n(More cons are welcome)\n\nMy positions:\n\n100 shares at $21.35\n\n7 calls for $40 05/21\n9 calls for $35 05/21\n1 call for $20 05/21\n\nDue to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week.

They are looking to replace metal casting and metal injection molding in the next 5 - 10 years. I believe that it could become a major player in the advanced manufacturing revolution and have 10x valuation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The share price right now is around $25. I am expecting it to go to at least $30 in the very near future and this can easily go to $100 in 2-3 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pros :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stellar team: The team consist of professors from MIT, engineers from google,  Stratasys and the likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients: All major automotive OEMs such as General Motors, Ford, Nissan as well as Electronics manufacturers such as SBD are their client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They just launched a new manufacturing system today. The new printer eliminated the solvent debind process which will decrease the cost and time of manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings are coming up on 11th Feb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average price target is around $26. The high is $30. The buy rating is around 70% with 0% sell rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has a 25% short interest. There are around 15000 $25 calls expiring on 19th Feb. The short sellers are trying to keep the price of the stock below $25. Notice that today the price jumped on the news of the new printer but fell immediately afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chamath did a PIPE investment in this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s 10th on the PRNT etf by Cathie Woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They just bought a dental 3d printing company which is a leader in their field. They have enough cash reserve to buy competitors and increase their revenue streams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cons :&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is still pre revenue. Earliest revenue would be by 2022 probably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huge competition from players such as 3ds, Stratasys, Formlabs etc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(More cons are welcome)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My positions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;100 shares at $21.35&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7 calls for $40 05/21\n9 calls for $35 05/21\n1 call for $20 05/21&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to all the positive sentiment around, this should easily run upto atleast $30 before the earnings. It has already touched $28 last week.

I've heard multiple versions of the story about how these work, all of which go something like this:\n&gt; To execute a short ladder attack, two bearish hedge funds trade shares of stock back and forth between each other at lower and lower prices in order to create the illusion that the price is dropping and scare owners into panic selling.\n\n**The TL;DR here is that short ladder attacks don't exist.** Due to the way the market is structured, activity like the kind described above can't affect prices in even the short run. To explain why, I'll first need to explain how the exchanges match up orders to execute trades.\n\n**The order book**\n\nFor every stock listed on major exchanges, there is a list of requests to buy a stock at a price (called bid orders) and a similar list of requests to sell (called ask orders). A typical bid order says something like \"I'm willing to buy 100 shares of company ABC at $10.00 per share\", and a typical ask order says something like \"I'm willing to sell 15 shares of ABC at $10.05 per share\". Exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ collect these orders into a list and sort them by price, so that the highest bid price and the lowest ask price sit on top of the respective sides of the order book. The difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask prices is called the spread.\n\nFor example, let's say that the two example orders above are the highest bid and lowest ask orders for ABC. If someone submits a market sell order of 20 shares of ABC, they will have the entire order executed at $10.00 per share. The bid price will remain at $10.00 per share, but there are now only 80 shares available at that price. If someone places a market buy order form 20 shares of ABC, they will have 15 shares executed at $10.05 and 5 shares executed at the next lowest ask price. This would widen the spread for ABC. If you place a limit buy order for 20 shares of ABC at $9.95 per share, this would go in the order book under the bid of $10.00, and you won't get your order filled until all shares listed for sale at $10.00 are sold first.\n\nSome of the highest volume traders are called \"market makers\". They place both bid and ask orders around recently traded prices and hope to make money buy collecting the spread. They can lose money if the movement in price is bigger than the spread, so spreads are typically wider for more volatile names. High frequency traders make money by looking at the structure of the order book and the order flow and using algorithms to predict which way it will move.\n\n**The NBBO and the SIP**\n\nNBBO stands for National Best Bid/Offer, and refers to the highest bid price and lowest ask price across all exchanges. According to SEC rules, any broker must execute their client's buy orders at the lowest ask price and the sell orders at the highest bid price. Quotes of the NBBO and records of trade prices and volume are broadcast on SIP (Security Information Processes) feeds, which all executing brokers are listening too so that they can make informed decisions about the market.\n\n**Why short attacks can't really work**\n\nWith this much information about the market being broadcast, the type of short attack described above is impossible. If potential short attackers executed a trade at a price lower than the national best bid, everyone listening to the SIP feed would know about it and their illegal activity would be extremely obvious. Certainly, whoever owned the bid at the top of the book would be pretty annoyed, since a worse buy order just got filled.\n\nAnd even if they don't wind up getting in trouble for it, the best bid price is still sitting there waiting to be filled by a sell order. Any broker executing a retail sell order would have to execute at the best available bid price according to the NBBO rules. And any market maker or high frequency trader will see what's happening and should know to ignore it.\n\nThe only way these shorters could actually drive the price down would be to burn through the entire buy side of the order book until they reach some target price. This can move the price down, but typically it gets harder and harder the further you get into the order book. High frequency traders and day trading algorithms would also be able to catch on and start placing bids so they can buy at these artificially low prices, and the impact of the short trade will decay over time. As a result, the bears would have increased the amount of short they needed to cover without moving the price all that much, and they'll have lost some money in the process.\n\n**So what causes market crashes like GME had on 1/29?**\n\nFor a crash like this to happen, sellers need to cross the spread to get their sells filled faster than the buy side of the book can replenish, causing the buy side of the book to thin out and vanish until it regains support at a lower level. This is basically order book speak for \"a lot more people wanted to sell than buy\". Beyond that it's hard to figure out exactly what happened, but it was probably a combination of some of the following:\n\n* Market makers had bought enough of GME that they didn't want to risk buying more and/or got a sell signal, so they pulled or lowered their bids\n* Bid side support from retail investors thinned or vanished after some brokers locked them out from buying more\n* Bid side support from previous shorts like Melvin thinned or vanished as shorts finished up covering their positions\n* New investors opened up short positions if they felt GME was overpriced\n* Some retail traders who rode the wave up took a profit at the perceived peak\n* As the price began to fall, retailers who bought on margin were forced to liquidate at market price (the exact opposite of a short squeeze)\n* As the price began to fall, long investors panicked and sold\n* As the price began to fall, sellers of options decreased their stake used to hedge as option delta decreased (a downward gamma squeeze)\n\nAnyone who sold at the top of this crash probably contributed to the decline, but that doesn't make it market manipulation. If a trader of any kind looked at the order book, decided the buy side was thin, and sold, that's just a good trade.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the notion of a short ladder attack is completely made up. Not only is it technically infeasible, but [there was little to no mention of it anywhere on the web just a couple weeks ago](https://www.truthorfiction.com/what-is-a-short-ladder-attack/).

Tell me what I'm missing please, particularly re. the path to profitability and the reinsurance topic.\n\n**Basics**\n\n* Lemonade says it's an insurance company that leverages AI to price risk better.\n* Lemonade claims to \"disrupt\" the insurance industry by using AI, implying all others don't.\n* Lemonade has a do-good attitude, borderline arrogant, to all of its marketing. This appeals to quite some folks primarily in the U.S., as their growing client numbers show.\n* The company was recently discussed by a bearish outlet called \"the friendly bear\", and by Citron. The Friendly Bear article is worth a reading imo, the Citron video was absolutely weak and didn't attack the company meaningfully.\n* From what I can tell, customers are either extremely happy or extremely disappointed with the company. The former are mainly - not only! - the ones that never submitted a claim and only experienced the sign-up process. My research is limited to reading reviews on the app store.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Bull case**\n\n* Lemonade's AI capability: If LMND does manage to use AI to price risk better than its competitors, this could result in lower loss ratios. However, note that AI typically needs a lot of data points; data points LMND has just started collecting. Heavy reliance on AI also reduces salary spending and should lead to low costs of adding incremental customers.\n* Target demographic: Below 40 year olds, due to hipster-oriented marketing and your phone being the only distribution channel. The idea is to grow alongside those customers.\n* Doing good: Parts of earnings go to the lemonade foundation and from there to charities pre-selected by policyholders.\n* Founder: Founders have founded and grown firms previously (Fiverr).\n* Growth potential: LMND is rapidly expanding its insurance offerings, having most recently started to offer pet insurance, life insurance.\n\n**Bear case**\n\n* Use of reinsurance: LMND cedes 75% of risks, and 75% of premiums received, to reinsurers. I think this is the main red flag here. Superior AI should allow them to underwrite only good risks, meaning they need less reinsurance - not more - than other insurance companies. The 25% ceding commission they gain is a small drop, it means they cede \"only\" 56% of premium, not the full 75%. Note that in addition to ceding 75%, they use even more reinsurance to manage the remaining 25% - meaning they probably retain about 20% of risk - and premium - themselves.\n* Use of reinsurance 2: The S1 (July 1, 2020) announces the plan to start ceding 75% starting in Q3. So one quarter after going public, the company dramatically changes it's business model for it's core business which is providing insurance. This is suspect to say the least.\n* Slight risk of misstating the truth: (Disclaimer: I can't judge as to whether this is illegal, nor do I want to enter that discussion). However, I believe that a) They might not actually pass the litmus test for being an insurance company. They are, at the moment, not more than a broker for reinsurers, that earns about 20 cents for every 1 dollar in premium.\n* Political risk: The charities one can select do not resonate with less liberal folks, according to app store reviews.\n* No path to profit visible: GWP in 3Q20 was 71.2, but ceded written premium was 118.6, resulting in NWP of -47.4. Losses and loss adjustment expenses decreased. Both is a result of the heavy reinsurance use. The gross earned premium figure in the 3Q20 can't be reconciled with prior quarters and the company presents gross earned premium of positive 42.9, but then another 32.4 are ceded to reinsurers, leading to revenue of only 17.8.\n* Use of AI most likely overstated: a) The firm has no significant R&amp;D spending - \"technology development\" is an own line item (5m in Q3) but it's four times less than sales and marketing, and half that of G&amp;A. This is clearly not an indicator LMND invests massively into its AI capabilities. Rather they seek to push top line. b) If AI is so good there would be less need for reinsurance because the AI would be capable to weed out bad risks. Instead, LMND uses a shitload of reinsurance.\n* Planned share issuance at 165$ - then at the all-time high, they announced the offering. A smart move that will bring in cash they need to grow (think advertising). And an indicator that mgmt thinks the stock is currently overvalued.\n* Abroad growth is slow: In Germany, LMND is a very tiny (think &lt;1% of market) player according to news by competitor wefox and by other articles. In France they won some lawsuit about the use of the color pink, but I haven't yet found any data on their market share there, I assume it's negligible.\n* The company's stock price started jumping once the stock was a suggested buy by motley fool. Motley fool regularly issues bullish articles on the stock. In addition, the firm seems - to me - to be actively marketing its shares through social media like tiktok. This sheds in my view a very dubious light on the firm.\n* Lack of insurance experience by chief executives. While they have succeeded founding companies and taking them public in the past, they have no insurance industry experience. I see this as a major red flag in such a complex industry.\n\n**My main issue / stuff that prevents me from going all-in on my bearish bet:**\n\n* No obvious catalyst visible that could trigger a big drop in share price - I'm afraid that if they keep growing customers, as top line grows, so will the stock price. I'm afraid investors see this as one of the only few \"hot new stocks\" in the insurance segment, leaving little alternative to investing if one wants to be part of innovation in insurance.\n* Side note: Timing-wise, one problem might arise in 3 years when they will have to renegotiate the 75% reinsurance agreements. If their AI sucks, then their risks are not above market average, and if that's the case, reinsurers might raise premium / reduce ceding commission. I see this as one potential catalyst, but it's far in the future.\n\n**Positions currently held, albeit with medium conviction only, and planning to hold at least after Q4 release:**\n\n* 2x LMND Feb 21 (Feb 12 expiration) 120P, currently worth 232$\n* 1x LMND Jan22 (Jan 21 expiration) 100P, currently worth 2900$\n* Side note: all options seem thinly traded and bid-ask is huge","html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to explain why I believe LMND is currently overvalued, and encourage you to please poke holes in my arguments. Tell me what I&amp;#39;m missing please, particularly re. the path to profitability and the reinsurance topic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lemonade says it&amp;#39;s an insurance company that leverages AI to price risk better.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lemonade claims to &amp;quot;disrupt&amp;quot; the insurance industry by using AI, implying all others don&amp;#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lemonade has a do-good attitude, borderline arrogant, to all of its marketing. This appeals to quite some folks primarily in the U.S., as their growing client numbers show.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The company was recently discussed by a bearish outlet called &amp;quot;the friendly bear&amp;quot;, and by Citron. The Friendly Bear article is worth a reading imo, the Citron video was absolutely weak and didn&amp;#39;t attack the company meaningfully.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;From what I can tell, customers are either extremely happy or extremely disappointed with the company. The former are mainly - not only! - the ones that never submitted a claim and only experienced the sign-up process. My research is limited to reading reviews on the app store.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bull case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lemonade&amp;#39;s AI capability: If LMND does manage to use AI to price risk better than its competitors, this could result in lower loss ratios. However, note that AI typically needs a lot of data points; data points LMND has just started collecting. Heavy reliance on AI also reduces salary spending and should lead to low costs of adding incremental customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Target demographic: Below 40 year olds, due to hipster-oriented marketing and your phone being the only distribution channel. The idea is to grow alongside those customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Doing good: Parts of earnings go to the lemonade foundation and from there to charities pre-selected by policyholders.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Founder: Founders have founded and grown firms previously (Fiverr).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Growth potential: LMND is rapidly expanding its insurance offerings, having most recently started to offer pet insurance, life insurance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bear case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use of reinsurance: LMND cedes 75% of risks, and 75% of premiums received, to reinsurers. I think this is the main red flag here. Superior AI should allow them to underwrite only good risks, meaning they need less reinsurance - not more - than other insurance companies. The 25% ceding commission they gain is a small drop, it means they cede &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; 56% of premium, not the full 75%.

Everything I am about to write has come from my own research. You should cross check everything and make your own decision on what you will do with this information.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This is not going to be a PUMP &amp; DUMP. I don't want to achieve that either. I report here because I am convinced of the idea and the company!\n\n**What is it about?**\n\nI've been watching an interesting company since December 2020 that advertises with the following slogan: \"We exist to decarbonize the currently high carbon production footprint of lithiumion batteries used in electric vehicles.\" The company is called Vulcan Energy Resources\\[1\\].\n\nISIN: AU0000066086\n\nWKN: A2PV3A\n\n**How did you find the company?**\n\nI became aware of the company because I see that there is a trend towards sustainable investing\\[2\\]. So I started looking for a company that appealed to me. At some point I came across an article that a project was underway to extract lithium without damaging the environment\\[3\\]. Gripped by the topic, I spent several days trying to find out what was going on and what it was all about.\n\n**What about sustainability?**\n\nZERO CARBON LITHIUM: The project is called Zero Carbon Lithium\\[4\\] and is being driven by Vulcan Energy Resources as mentioned above. The current main way to extract and refine lithium, from hard rock mines, will emit about 1.05 billion tons of CO2 to produce the amount of lithium needed to electrify all the world's passenger cars. Unlike current lithium extraction methods, Zero Carbon Lithium will have virtually no impact on the public or the environment. That means no large open pit mines, no large, unsightly, water-guzzling evaporation ponds, or process plants that run on fossil fuels.\n\nAfter reading that, I was hooked for now. But not yet ready to invest. Moreover, the share was still a penny stock at the time. That was too risky for me. So I looked weekly to see if something is about to happen.\n\n**The Decision:**\n\nInvesting based on an idea is never a good idea, so I took a close look at the company and the idea:\n\n1. Since I already had a bad experience once, with such a young idea, I first looked how often and how well information is published\\[5\\]. Surprisingly, it is published diligently and everything fits so far. ✔\n2. Publishing is one thing, the other is whether there is something behind it. Since listed companies have a disclosure obligation, it is easy to see whether the figures from the Investor Centre correspond to those on the stock exchange\\[6\\]. ✔\n3. Financially, you can't do an analysis á la Warren Buffet here. The company is still young, and has a lot to invest. Nevertheless, I took a look at what is going on. Quick Analysis: More assets than liabilities ✔. Equity consistently increased ✔. Cash flow and net income: naturally in the red due to the investments ✖. More does not make sense here, as said value investing does not work here.\n4. Vulcan operates a lot of geothermal plants and is familiar with the matter. So there is internal and independent expertise in geothermal and lithium on site for project execution\\[7\\]. ✔\n5. Location - the right market, compelling supply-demand dynamics: being at the center of the European lithium ion battery industry is a major advantage for a semi-bulk product. Europe will be the world's fastest-growing lithium ion battery production center in the 2020s, with no local supply of lithium hydroxide.\\[7\\] ✔\n6. Positive framework study: world-leading industry experts in lithium extraction and geothermal energy are behind the first study of its kind, which provides a solid foundation for the start of feasibility studies planned soon.\\[7\\] ✔\n7. I understood how the process works and read the feasibility study.Not only lithium is extracted but also other rare metals\\[9\\]. ✔\n\nIf you go through my sources with interest, you will see that there is a very solid basis behind the project. But what was the deciding point for me to invest was the fact that Vulcan intentionally requested a trading halt while they were conducting the study to prevent wild speculation. This happened once in January2021\\[9\\] and once now around February 2021\\[10\\]. I got in in January because that was a sign to me that Vulcan was serious.\n\nIn addition, Vulcan gave a presentation to the EU Commission, with positive feedback. Vulcan has signed a binding agreement with the EU-funded EIT InnoEnergy as part of the Business Investment Platform (BIP) of the European Battery Alliance (EBA) initiative of the European Commission. This agreement is expected to significantly accelerate the momentum of Vulcan's Zero Carbon Lithium project. The project is located in Germany, at the center of the fastest growing lithium market in the world: the European battery industry for electric vehicles \\[11\\].\n\n**What's in store for the future?**\n\nI can't see into the future, of course, but I am sure that with this project electric vehicles will gain significant momentum. Also, the EU would be more independent and I personally like that a lot. In addition, there is no need to dry salt lakes or make bad environmental cuts like in other countries. I also see it critically that we consume here, and in mines at the other end of the world people have to work life-threatening for our luxury.\n\n**Is $VUL the next $GME?**\n\nPlease, this is not a comparison. This is about the environment and the future of next generations. I am against PUMP&amp;DUMP! If you are convinced of a company you invest and don't gamble!\n\n**Is now the right time?**\n\nI do not know. You have to decide that for yourself. I am invested myself in the meantime, because I am convinced of the idea therefore I will hold the share also with fluctuations. I got in at \\~4.00 - 5.00€.\n\nSources:\n\n\\[1\\] Vulcan Energy Resources: [https://v-er.com/](https://v-er.com/)\n\n\\[2\\] Sustainable Investing Trend: [https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/sustainability-investing-institutional-asset-owners](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/sustainability-investing-institutional-asset-owners)\n\n\\[3\\] Lithium Geothermal energy: [https://www.electrive.net/2020/06/15/lithium-gewinnung-aus-geothermie-anlagen-in-deutschland/](https://www.electrive.net/2020/06/15/lithium-gewinnung-aus-geothermie-anlagen-in-deutschland/)\n\n\\[4\\] Zero Carbon Lithium: [https://v-er.com/zero-carbon-lithium/](https://v-er.com/zero-carbon-lithium/)\n\n\\[5\\] Vulcan Investor Centre: [https://v-er.com/investor-centre/](https://v-er.com/investor-centre/)\n\n\\[6\\] Yahoo Finance VUL: [https://de.finance.yahoo.com/quote/6KO.F/financials?p=6KO.F](https://de.finance.yahoo.com/quote/6KO.F/financials?p=6KO.F)\n\n\\[7\\] Vulcan Facts: [https://www.geothermie.de/bibliothek/lexikon-der-geothermie/v/vulkan-energy-firma.html](https://www.geothermie.de/bibliothek/lexikon-der-geothermie/v/vulkan-energy-firma.html)\n\n\\[8\\] Vulcan Positive Pre Feasibility Study: [https://vul.live.irmau.com/site/PDF/6a9c79d2-5c99-40d7-ba32-72cd6ea3a6f6/PositivePreFeasibilityStudy](https://vul.live.irmau.com/site/PDF/6a9c79d2-5c99-40d7-ba32-72cd6ea3a6f6/PositivePreFeasibilityStudy)\n\n\\[9\\] Trading Halt January2021: [https://vul.live.irmau.com/site/PDF/e5371199-d0f8-4d91-82b1-f7e1ed7ebae6/TradingHalt](https://vul.live.irmau.com/site/PDF/e5371199-d0f8-4d91-82b1-f7e1ed7ebae6/TradingHalt)\n\n\\[10\\] Trading Halt February 2021: [https://vul.live.irmau.com/site/PDF/492bcfbd-6157-4aec-8542-f6641341578f/TradingHalt](https://vul.live.irmau.com/site/PDF/492bcfbd-6157-4aec-8542-f6641341578f/TradingHalt)\n\n\\[11\\] Vulcan signs with EU: [https://finfeed.com/small-caps/juniors/vul-signs-agreement-with-eu-backed-body-to-drive-the-vulcan-zero-carbon-lithium-project/](https://finfeed.com/small-caps/juniors/vul-signs-agreement-with-eu-backed-body-to-drive-the-vulcan-zero-carbon-lithium-project/)","html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to make it clear from the start that I am not a professional financial advisor.

This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.*\n\nBefore I get into Monday's action, a couple of things:\n\nI wanted to first give a shout out to /u/piddlesthethug for capturing [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/RI1WOuu), which shows that moment in time I referenced in my [third Gamestop post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/), where some poor soul got sniped while sweeping the 29 January 115 calls.  I added it into the post with an edit, but my guess is most who read the post a while back would have missed it.  I guess my mental math in the moment was off as you can see from the image that the cost was actually just shy of $500k rather than $440k as I wrote in the post.  Brutal.\n\nPeople have also asked me where I stand on this trade.  I was lucky to get in early, trade some momentum, and retain a sizeable core holding (relative to my play account).  As I've mentioned some comments, my core holding, which I will hold until this saga plays itself out, would buy me a new car, all cash.  Though after today I'd have to downgrade from a lower end Lexus to a Corolla lol.\n\nAlright, so, today's action.\n\nI have to admit that I was just glancing at the chart between writing emails, working on excel spreadsheets, conference calls, and meetings.  Whenever I could, I was listening to CNBC in the background, and taking a closer look whenever I heard anything that might move sentiment, or theoretically telegraph an attack as had happened so many times last week.\n\nIn my opinion the price action played out almost by-the-numbers according to a squeeze campaign strategy as I laid out in my previous post.  I want to be clear, however, that while it was consistent with what I laid out (liquidity drying up, trying to skirmish at lower and lower price points), you could reasonably interpret it other ways.  As I mentioned in at least one comment, seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct.  It just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far.  Always keep that in mind.\n\nI tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as I got notifications on my phone.  Just as a heads up, I won't always be able to do so, and it seems like there were a number of knowledgeable people commenting in realtime anyway.  As I've said in comments on my previous posts, I am definitely not the smartest person in the room, so don't just take my word for it just because I'm the original poster.  Please challenge anything I say if you feel I'm mistaken, and don't dismiss out of hand people who may have a different viewpoint.\n\nOne thing I thought I noticed in early morning market hours action was that there was no sell order depth above the ticker price, which I interpret as a good sign.  Downward pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a low-volume vacuum.  The most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open.  Tons of volume to push the price down, then a tiny fraction of volume as price got sucked back up.  This means very little continued panicking and bailing due to the aggressive push, resulting in gaps to the upside on the follow-on buying.  There were messages and comments from people concerned that low price would let the short side cover, but, as I explained, low price doesn't help the short side unless they can buy at that low price in meaningful volume.  That sort of action where price gaps up as soon as buying (whether by shorts or longs) is driving price tells you that there isn't much meaningful volume to be had at the lower prices.  From a higher level view, volume through the day dropped as price dropped, and that seems to have remained consistently true throughout the day.\n\nThere was some very strange after-market volume.  No idea what that may have been, other than maybe hedge unwinding as T+2 contract settlement outcomes were determined.  It seemed, at least to me, to be too much volume in too dense a time window to be retailers bailing out of their accounts en mass.  It would make no sense to do so into the vacuum of after hours anyway rather than the firmer price support of market hours.\n\nI got messages that I was both a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples' money.  My sentiment analysis KPIs thus indicate I'm likely striking a healthy balance (lol).\n\n# The Game (Theory)\n\nOk, but seriously, is this situation a pump and dump?\n\nPossibly.\n\nI say possibly because, as I stated in a comment, a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier.  Even worse, in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side.  Not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the start--it's just what ends up happening if the campaign fails.\n\nOk, so failure aside, what are the dynamics of the trade?  What kind of game is this?\n\nIn simplified terms, I'd describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified [dollar auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_auction) where the winning side also takes the losing side's bid money.  In other words, at an aggregate level, it's winner take all, go hard or go home, with all the excitement of market action in the middle.  Note that I said in aggregate and with market action in the middle, as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end.  As I mentioned in some comments where I urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money, this is going to be a white-knuckle trade to the very end.\n\n# Power\n\nFor most of our lives, most of the time, the saying that 'information is power' and the closely related 'knowledge is power' are abstract, philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy.  More tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be 'money is power', or, for the least fortunate, the threat and reality of physical force.\n\nToday, for many in the GME trade, that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance.  What is current SI?  Can you trust numbers from S3?  What about Ortex?  Are there counterfeit shares in play?  What is the significance of Failures to Deliver? Can the short side cover their position off the exchange? etc. etc.\n\nBeing in this situation, if nothing else, has lifted the veil for many people.  The right information, in the right circumstances, is incredibly powerful.  It outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry.\n\nIf you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor, you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information. Do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated.  Most of all, try to avoid developing a [siege mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_mentality) at all costs.  If nothing else, in my opinion, it's critical for your long-term financial success.\n\nI don't know the answer to those questions definitively, and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything I write.  In fact, it would make me happier if I see people use some of the tools, techniques, and concepts I've tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking.  Catching my mistakes helps me.  Doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone.\n\n# Faith, Conviction, Calculated Risk\n\nMany people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies.\n\nSome people, including those that most Wall Street types consider to be 'responsible' investors, invest on blind faith.  You put your capital is someone else's hands (hopefully a qualified fiduciary), and trust that they will do a good job.  The only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the person(s) in which to place your faith.  This is not entirely unlike what many WSBettors are doing with respect to DFV.  I do this with my retirement accounts, though lately I've been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a self-directed IRA.\n\nOthers trade on conviction.  They have, for whatever reason, a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk, and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light.  I consider value investors to fall into this category.\n\nOthers are momentum traders and 'technical analysts', who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity.  These opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis.  All that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk.\n\nI think it's healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches.  I personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches mid-trade.  I.e., if you started in the GME trade on faith, it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the no-man's land between faith and conviction, where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade, but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out.  I'm not saying you shouldn't try to make that transition--just try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions.\n\n# Swimming In The Deep\n\nSo, the consistent #1 question I always get: what happens next?  My consistent answer, which I know frustrates everyone, is I don't know, and no one else does either.\n\nOne person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth, which some may find disturbing, is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the driver's seat.  This may very well be true.  I would give it better than even odds at this point.  In fact, even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade, retail is not a well-organized, monolithic entity, and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times.\n\nAnother question I got, which was a very good one to be asking, is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side?  For me, there have been critical actions over the past few days that I would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors, such as the sustained HFT duel into the close on Friday.  That was very consistent, relatively well controlled, and sustained push on volume of 6-7mio shares traded in the $250 - $330/share price range.  Oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of $2bn in capital flow.  That is not retail--particularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time.  The 17mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze (and Ortex reported reduction in short interest) is also definitely not retail.  Others have pointed out massive action in the options today.  Tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high 6 figures.  Not retail.\n\nAll of that being said, does that really change very much?  Even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement, and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows (I do, which is why I'm writing these posts and holding that core position), in the end you are trading as an individual.  This is a point that I have made repeatedly.  In the end, you need to know yourself, know your trade, and have a plan.  Your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else (I know many are following DFV to whatever the end may be), but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual.\n\nIf my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes, and price grinding down to a floor of harder support, possibly even at the retail line of support (\\~$148/$150) I outlined in a prior post.  There may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract T+2 settlement impact.  I don't know enough about what to expect there.  If the squeeze is to happen, unless RH lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum, it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while (maybe days, maybe longer), until sufficient liquid float has been locked up.\n\nRight now options action is heavily weighted to puts, so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price.\n\nIf the squeeze fails to happen there won't be a siren, ringing of a bell, or anything like that.  It might happen gradually and non-obviously until suddenly, as only the market seems to be able to do, it becomes obvious that whoever's still there has been left holding the bag.  Hopefully this isn't the case, but if it is I'll be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car lol.\n\nIf it succeeds, it should be fairly obvious.  Just don't forget to ring the register!\n\nEither way, this is market history in the making.  As I said in a previous comment, when you ride the rocket, it's definitely not going to be smooth--but it might just be awesome.\n\nApologies for the lengthy post again.

That was very consistent, relatively well controlled, and sustained push on volume of 6-7mio shares traded in the $250 - $330/share price range.  Oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of $2bn in capital flow.  That is not retail--particularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time.  The 17mio shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze (and Ortex reported reduction in short interest) is also definitely not retail.  Others have pointed out massive action in the options today.  Tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high 6 figures.  Not retail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All of that being said, does that really change very much?  Even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement, and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows (I do, which is why I&amp;#39;m writing these posts and holding that core position), in the end you are trading as an individual.  This is a point that I have made repeatedly.  In the end, you need to know yourself, know your trade, and have a plan.  Your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else (I know many are following DFV to whatever the end may be), but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes, and price grinding down to a floor of harder support, possibly even at the retail line of support (~$148/$150) I outlined in a prior post.  There may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract T+2 settlement impact.  I don&amp;#39;t know enough about what to expect there.  If the squeeze is to happen, unless RH lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum, it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while (maybe days, maybe longer), until sufficient liquid float has been locked up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now options action is heavily weighted to puts, so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the squeeze fails to happen there won&amp;#39;t be a siren, ringing of a bell, or anything like that.  It might happen gradually and non-obviously until suddenly, as only the market seems to be able to do, it becomes obvious that whoever&amp;#39;s still there has been left holding the bag.  Hopefully this isn&amp;#39;t the case, but if it is I&amp;#39;ll be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car lol.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it succeeds, it should be fairly obvious.  Just don&amp;#39;t forget to ring the register!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Either way, this is market history in the making.  As I said in a previous comment, when you ride the rocket, it&amp;#39;s definitely not going to be smooth--but it might just be awesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the lengthy post again.

We all know it’s a great business. \n\nWhat I want to focus on is the financials. More specifically: **We already know Q4 results and nobody is talking about it! Why? Because nobody looked!!!**\n\nCorsair recently posted a prospectus related to the sale of 7.5M shares by some insiders (totally normal as it’s mostly the private equity owner – EagleTree - selling a small bit and passing from 78.32% to 68.55% ownership - they sold 7,135,000 out of the 7,500,000 sold… It’s totally fair for the PE owner to cash out a bit). \n\nHere’s the **prospectus (dated 21st of January 2021**): [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/22acfc88-2f42-4b16-8bbb-099323323f33) \n\n**1)** Now, check out page 9 of the document \n\n  **For the year ended December 31, 2020, we expect:** \n\n**• Net revenue to be between approximately $1,700 million and $1,701 million** \n\n**• Net income to be between approximately $101 million and $103 million**\n\n**• Adjusted EBITDA to be between approximately $211 and $213 million**   \n \n\nYes, we already know they have beaten their own updated estimates…\n\nIn fact, the company initially estimated the following (*from Q3 release* [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))\n\nFor the full year 2020, we currently expect: \n\n• Net revenue to be in the range of $1,616 million to $1,631 million.\n\n• Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $178 million to $184 million. \n\n• Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $187 million to $193 million.  \n\nThen, they updated the *guidance on November 30th 2020* ([https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-updates-full-year-2020-outlook)): \n\nFor the full year 2020, we currently expect:\n\n* Net revenue to be in the range of $1,651 million to $1,666 million.\n* Adjusted operating income to be in the range of $186 million to $192 million.\n* Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $194 million to $200 million.  \n \n\n**So they have beaten their own initial and revisited estimates. Great!! Really great!!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2)** But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look). \n\nAs they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.\n\nIn the more recent prospectus (page 10): \n\n*In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.*   \n \n\n**This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.** As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So **this implies around 150M FCF in 2020** (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M). \n\n(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here [https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d))\n\n   \nAt $39, Corsair has a 3.5Bn market cap (91.92M of shares outstanding).\n\nThis is a very respectable cash flow yield of 4.2%. I’d be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is (60.7% growth year-over-year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of 69.4% in Q4).\n\n\\-----\n\nNow, you must be thinking: but the smart money already knows this! They have accounted for it!\n\nI used to be like you… I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things! \n\nNo f\\*\\*\\* way!!!\n\nTake a look at Goldman Sachs’ research from February 1st 2021 (yes, after the prospectus was published). \n\nSomeone shared it on reddit\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/nrmzjy9lw3f61.png?width=4129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c3bf8e1c1308a15dbbb26b519c58a4d7dea8ab0](https://preview.redd.it/nrmzjy9lw3f61.png?width=4129&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c3bf8e1c1308a15dbbb26b519c58a4d7dea8ab0)\n\n   \nThey still base themselves on the updated guidance of November 30th 2020. No mention whatsoever of the much more recently updated “guidance” (more than a guidance, it’s actually the results given how close the ranges are…)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: Corsair is a great company and its results are already out! \n\nMake your own investment decisions!","html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“While the whole world was having a big old party, a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could.

Really great!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; But that’s not all we can easily infer from the Prospectus dated January 21, 2021 (Again… we just need to look). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As they mention on the Q3 report, “as of September 30, 2020, we had cash and restricted cash of $120.1 million, $48.0 million capacity under our revolving credit facility and total long-term debt of $370.1 million”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the more recent prospectus (page 10): &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to the foregoing, as of December 31, 2020, we expect to have approximately $133 million in cash and restricted cash and we expect to have net debt of approximately $194 million following the repayment of $50.0 million in existing debt with cash on hand during the quarter ended December 31, 2020.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This means that they have reduced net debt from $250M ($370 - $120 of cash) to $194M, which implies $56M of free cash flow generated during the quarter.&lt;/strong&gt; As a reminder, they generated around 21M FCF in q3 2020 and 94M in the first 9 months of 2020. So &lt;strong&gt;this implies around 150M FCF in 2020&lt;/strong&gt; (as a reference in the first 9 months of 2019, they had negative FCF of about 6M). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(check cash flow statement at page 14 on the Q3 report here &lt;a href=\"https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d\"&gt;https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/9eeb96ec-6c9b-47f6-a7e5-6c9f0312b50d&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At $39, Corsair has a 3.5Bn market cap (91.92M of shares outstanding).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a very respectable cash flow yield of 4.2%. I’d be expecting a much lower yield from a company growing as fast as Corsair is (60.7% growth year-over-year in Q3 and, assuming sales of 554M for Q4 vs 327M for Q4 2019, a growth of 69.4% in Q4).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, you must be thinking: but the smart money already knows this! They have accounted for it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I used to be like you… I used to think the market was efficient and that big funds and banks were always looking carefully at things! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No f*** way!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a look at Goldman Sachs’ research from February 1st 2021 (yes, after the prospectus was published). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Someone shared it on reddit&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nrmzjy9lw3f61.png?width=4129&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0c3bf8e1c1308a15dbbb26b519c58a4d7dea8ab0\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/nrmzjy9lw3f61.png?width=4129&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0c3bf8e1c1308a15dbbb26b519c58a4d7dea8ab0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They still base themselves on the updated guidance of November 30th 2020.

This will allow to compare it to your own personal risk/reward aims. In case risk/reward ratio is acceptable, my next steps are always the same:\n\n1) Buy immediately, even if you think you're at the ATH, because if you believe in the growth potential that ATH will not matter compared to the ATH you'll achieve. Additionally, it is incredibly hard to time the crypto market and ordinary TA often doesn’t apply here. There’s plenty of people who were waiting for a better moment to get in (a dip) just to find themselves buying at yet another ATH thus paying extra.\n\n2) Either, DCA up or down, depending on the next price move. This seems odd, why would you want to DCA up, but I use this as an insurance against sudden major price drops in exchange of a share of the potential gains. When doing a DCA down, I never buy until at least 20% drop.

So alts need to outperform Bitcoin, meaning Bitcoin dominance dropping and alts growing in sat value (for instance ETH/BTC ratio going up).\n\n**Bitcoin Dominance.**\n\nThe Bitcoin dominance metric looks at Bitcoins value relative to the total crypto market, how much of all the money into crypto is currently stored in Bitcoin? Lets take a look at the chart:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Bitcoin dominance has been trending down since Bitcoin had its massive run up from the beginning August till the end of December hitting a dominance of 72.5&amp;#37;, currently sitting at 62.6&amp;#37; dominance and trending lower.](https://preview.redd.it/jco7qx6v59f61.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8eaa99760a2f61d4bdcd843378845cd05aba30fc)\n\n**How did it look like in 2018?**\n\nas we all know in 2018 altcoins got a massive run up going up outperforming bitcoin baring enormous gains for all people invested in them. Lets take a look at the chart from that time period:\n\n[On the first drop on the left the Bitcoin dominance fell from 77&amp;#37; to 52&amp;#37;, the second drop it went from 70&amp;#37; to 30&amp;#37;. ](https://preview.redd.it/v78aqpl229f61.png?width=1858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de8ac24d758ab38b59481f744f3748110df9442f)\n\n**Where are we now?**\n\nWith all the new investors coming into crypto  and some coins significantly outperforming BTC over the last 90 days (ETH up 272%, DOT 309%, UNI 850% to name a few) I think we're in for the first small altseason of this run with the Bitcoin dominance falling below 50% for a short period of time. After this it is likely to see a big surge in Bitcoin again (could take a while!) as profits flow back to the nr. 1 coin.

With all that extra money in the markets assets tend to be less volatile.

After this it is likely to see a big surge in Bitcoin again (could take a while!) as profits flow back to the nr. 1 coin.

This is just my thoughts on the issue and by no means exhaustive. I welcome comments and my biggest recommendation if you fell for one of these schemes is to accept it, address your emotions, seek support - either by those around you or here if you feel more comfortable, then commit to educating yourself. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n___\n\n\n#**Summary:**#\n**A pump and dump scheme** is where a group of people pitch a coin (or stock) to other people to spike short term volume, and therefore the price, in order to profit from selling their own supply at the higher price to the newer investors.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**How to spot a PnD:**\n\n- Promises of huge gains\n\n- Forced short time frames to make a decision\n\n- No discussion of risk - or questioning permitted\n\n- The opportunity finds you, you don't find the opportunity\n\n- Comparison to recent success stories - e.g. GME (dubious whether this will even be a success long term for individuals)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n**Tips to avoid** - see below but the main two for me are: \n\n- Recognise emotional decision making, in yourself, and when it comes from others (people you may normally trust). You need to recognise this behaviour, and cut it out at source. To step back and breathe.\n\n- Ask yourself, what are they selling me on, and why? If they find you, you are being sold. That is all there is to it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n___\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**What is a Pump and Dump scheme?**#\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nA Pump and Dump scheme (PnD from here on in), is where an investor, or group of investors promote a coin they already hold (or are purchasing) in order to cause positive sentiment and the price to rise. At this point these investors will then sell their coins to the newer investors, causing the price to crash and leave the people who fell for the PnD with a large potential loss, or coins which are now worth a lot less than the price they paid for them.\n\n\nThese are not new and were traditionally done via phone call. If you have watched the Wolf of Wall Street, or similar films about penny stocks, you have seen this stuff in action. If you are buying, you are the retail investor who gets taken for a ride.\n\n\nWith the recent influx of new users to this site, and following the PnD schemes surrounding Doge and XRP, lets take a look at how to spot a PnD scheme\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n___\n\n\n\n#**How to spot a PnD scheme?**#\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Promises of huge gains, in a short amount of time.** If it sounds too good to be true, it is. In crypto (and stocks) if someone is talking to you about something, they are selling you their position. If it is positive - they likely own it, if it negative - they either want prices to fall or they hold a competitor. Ask yourself, why someone would be going out their way to tell you something is a once in a lifetime opportunity? If it was, they would be keeping it secret and accumulating themselves. These people are salesman, and you are the one buying the bullshit\n\n\n\n\n\n- Linked to the above there is often a **time element - 'get in quick, or you will miss it'**, they are relying on your impulsive decision making to jump in - they are manipulating you to over ride the logical part of your brain which makes decisions based on information and context\n\n\n\n\n- There is **no discussion of any potential risks or downsides**, and you are removed from groups or harassed for asking basic questions - this is a hive mind at work, and you are being censored from raising any concern or legitimate question.\n\n\n\n- There may be reference to 'how this time is different', or it **plays on recent successes** which are in no way comparable - e.g Game Stop - anyone who paused for a second would realise why not only was financially the short squeeze on GME completely different, but also the moral stand point was too. XRP, for example, is a centralised system which enriches the founders beyond belief. Yet these groups tried to ride the sentiment of GME to convince others to join - as a show of rebellion and alliance.\n\n\n\n- **Social media storms are cooked up**, it seems like out of nowhere this is all anyone can talk about - when has this ever proven a successful decision? Once everyone is talking about it, you are already too late. You may not lose money, if you are lucky, but you are still the one being duped. Again this is feeding on emotion and Fear of Missing Out. There will be groups created and ran by mods who run them like cults - no talk of anything but price going up is accepted.\n\n\n\n- **There is a time or plan attached** - e.g. Pump and Hold at 8:30. For the love of god, if this is the case, sell before then. All the leaders of these groups will have done. All of these public announcements are done again to create legitimacy and make you feel at ease - as a collective.\n\n\n\n- Generally any concept of **'we are in this together'**, coming from a group trying to actively push up the price of something short term = PnD. You are not in this together, markets are competitive - they are survival of the fittest whether you like it or not. They want your money, when you listen to them - you are basically offering to hand it over. People invest to make money, especially when the entire premise is pushing a price up to get rich. They do not want what is good for you, they are using you and they will take your money if you allow them to. They are telling you, because you are the opportunity - not the coin.\n\n\n\n- **Be aware, people telling you to hold and buy more, are using you.** They want you to push the price back up so they can sell. If you are in these groups - on social media, be aware you may be talking to bots, or at the least people who are trying to dump on you. When it drops, get out.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n___\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#**How to avoid PnDs in future**#\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **'Why are they telling me this?'** - this is the first and main question to ask yourself. What does the person sharing the information have to gain from telling me? In this case - you invest and push the price up, allowing them to make greater profit. Understand why they would be sharing details with you - if it such a great thing, why are they sharing it?\n\n\n- **if it is a friend telling you, ask for more information** - why it is doing well, what the plan is etc - if they can't explain it properly, this is a big red flag and they likely have fallen for it too.\n\n\n- **Look out for how someone talks to you about it** - is it emotionally driven, does it make you excited? scared to miss out? - This is exactly when you need to step back, breathe and ask yourself if you are thinking correctly. Emotional decision making is not a good thing here, and then ask if they are intentionally trying to get an emotional reaction out of you? (see the above - FOMO, get rich quick etc)\n\n\n- **Is there any room for nuance?** Are you able to discuss the potential cons or risk? If you are laughed at, or harassed, others are told to ignore you (he won't be getting rich, weak hands, pathetic seller) - this is a huge sign that you are investing in something where no other thoughts are allowed. The reason for this, once you are out the bubble - logic returns and you see the smoke and mirrors for what they are. PnD groups work like a cult, only one form of thinking is allowed, everything else is censored.\n\n\n- **Did this come out of nowhere, do I even know anything about this?** If you don't know anything about it, except it makes money, don't invest in it. This is a terrible decision for two reasons. Firstly, and most obviously, you have asymmetric information - you have no idea why and what you are buying, therefore can't make an informed decision - only an emotional one. Equally, this kind of thing pushes panicked, emotional selling. When you don't know fundamental reasons why you invest in something, when the price dips you will sell. Why? because when your brain asks you the question 'shit it is dropping, what do we do?!' - your logical brain won't have an answer, because you never gave it the information to form one. This second part is more relevant to regular investments, not PnDs of course, but is worth bearing in mind before you invest in anything.\n\n\n- **Was the coin relatively stagnant, or has it dipped recently?** PnDs typically target coins which haven't moved much recently, or have lower trading volume, this allows for a much easier spiking of the price due to a small change in demand equalling a big change in price. If you look at the charts and it was doing nothing until this big flurry of activity - you are being taken for a ride.\n\n\n- **Look for the news**, if it is pumping, don't listen to people inside the group - search for reasons why something is pumping. If you can't find anything of value, there probably isn't anything, and you are gambling on emotional decisions.\n\n\n- **The opportunity finds you, you don't find the opportunity.** Getting rich off 'undervalued' coins, or finding a hidden gem is not easy. They are hidden for a reason. If someone is coming to you with this, remember they are selling. You are buying.\n\n\n- **If someone does approach you, talk to someone else outside of the bubble** - find another group e.g. r/CC, or other investors - talk to them, get outside perspective before investing. \n\n\n- **look for examples of populist sentiment**. Do you hear things about an other? - e.g. haters, those missing out who are jealous. Are you made to feel like you are part of a special group? The ones with insider information? This is a lie, it is very very common manipulation within populist movements, cults etc - to create a narrative of an other to entrench tribalism within the group. This is done to make you switch your brain off, to rule on emotion.\n\n\n- **is there a recent comparable story that was successful?** e.g. GME (yes this isn't the same at all in reality, but the story being sold is - or at least plays on the hype of GME). If there is, you are being played. The real opportunity, just like the hidden gem, is the first one. When people tell you this is happening again, they are simply using the positive news from one case and applying it to their own - often because it lacks any actual, real, tangible reason for succeeding or being a good investment.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n___\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n#**I fell for a PnD, what next?**#\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Have you sold yet - No? Are you in profit?** Sell. Whilst you still can. Greed will tell you not to, and perhaps you can eek out a little more money. But you are gambling, and gambling extremely high risk against people trying to take all your money.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Yes, you have sold. Did you make a profit? Yes** - great. You are still a an idiot, just a lucky one. Tell yourself that. There is a difference between opportunist traders taking advantage of PnDs and someone getting lucky and getting out before it collapses. Do not confuse the two. The first group know what they are doing (and they may still lose, but they are aware of the real risk). You are fucking lucky. Don't do it again. So count your blessings, go through the same process of learning about PnDs and begin to understand why you fell for it, how to avoid it in future and realise you are up - you won. Don't go back in, you are asking to lose.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n**Yes you have sold? Did you make profit? No?** Ok, this is normal - 90% + of people doing this will end up in the same situation. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n- **Recognise and accept your mistake**. Do not feel ashamed of it, it is ok. You were played, it happens to all of us in our lives at some point. \n\n- **Step away** from whatever device you used to invest. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WIN IT BACK RIGHT AWAY. You will most likely make things worse, investing again on emotions - even worse emotions now, shame, anger, disbelief.\n\n- **Talk** to the important people in your life if you feel comfortable, if not, come here or to other anonymous groups for support. It is important to share what happened, to vent emotionally whatever it is you feel.\n\n\n- **Realise it is only money**, even if gambled way more than you should have done, long term you will get out of this. Focus on other areas of your life for the time being - emotional investment, fulfilment and development - seek out things which may centre to your emotions again, whatever that may be - getting out in nature, cooking, reading, adrenaline sports - whatever the shit you need, do it. \n\n- **Consider who, if anyone needs to know.** Did you borrow from you and your wife's joint account? Accept a loan from a mate? These people need to know the truth. Do not hide it and hope to win it back. Tell the truth. They deserve it. \n\n- **Do not repeat the same actions**, if you want to win long term from this - you need a different approach. Step away from the high stakes casino and figure out long term strategies to make money. \n\n\n- **Learn to diversify and manage risk**. You are taking a huge gamble going all in on something - even if it isn't a scam, you need to protect yourself through diversifying your investments. Get rich quick schemes are the fastest way to lose money.\n\n\n- **Educate yourself on these behaviours** - I would recommend *'Thinking Fast and Slow'* by Daniel Kahnemann as a personal favourite. This book helps to look at and address the biases that make up our emotional decision making, and learn how to recognise these and instead 'think slow'. You won't regret reading it.","html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR:&lt;/strong&gt; Following the recent DOGE and XRP situations, and our influx of new users - I have decided to put together a quick guide on what a pump and dump is, how to spot it, how to avoid it, and what to do should you fall for one.

All of these public announcements are done again to create legitimacy and make you feel at ease - as a collective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally any concept of &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#39;we are in this together&amp;#39;&lt;/strong&gt;, coming from a group trying to actively push up the price of something short term = PnD. You are not in this together, markets are competitive - they are survival of the fittest whether you like it or not. They want your money, when you listen to them - you are basically offering to hand it over. People invest to make money, especially when the entire premise is pushing a price up to get rich. They do not want what is good for you, they are using you and they will take your money if you allow them to. They are telling you, because you are the opportunity - not the coin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be aware, people telling you to hold and buy more, are using you.&lt;/strong&gt; They want you to push the price back up so they can sell. If you are in these groups - on social media, be aware you may be talking to bots, or at the least people who are trying to dump on you. When it drops, get out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid PnDs in future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#39;Why are they telling me this?&amp;#39;&lt;/strong&gt; - this is the first and main question to ask yourself. What does the person sharing the information have to gain from telling me? In this case - you invest and push the price up, allowing them to make greater profit. Understand why they would be sharing details with you - if it such a great thing, why are they sharing it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;if it is a friend telling you, ask for more information&lt;/strong&gt; - why it is doing well, what the plan is etc - if they can&amp;#39;t explain it properly, this is a big red flag and they likely have fallen for it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look out for how someone talks to you about it&lt;/strong&gt; - is it emotionally driven, does it make you excited? scared to miss out? - This is exactly when you need to step back, breathe and ask yourself if you are thinking correctly. Emotional decision making is not a good thing here, and then ask if they are intentionally trying to get an emotional reaction out of you? (see the above - FOMO, get rich quick etc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any room for nuance?&lt;/strong&gt; Are you able to discuss the potential cons or risk? If you are laughed at, or harassed, others are told to ignore you (he won&amp;#39;t be getting rich, weak hands, pathetic seller) - this is a huge sign that you are investing in something where no other thoughts are allowed. The reason for this, once you are out the bubble - logic returns and you see the smoke and mirrors for what they are. PnD groups work like a cult, only one form of thinking is allowed, everything else is censored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did this come out of nowhere, do I even know anything about this?&lt;/strong&gt; If you don&amp;#39;t know anything about it, except it makes money, don&amp;#39;t invest in it. This is a terrible decision for two reasons. Firstly, and most obviously, you have asymmetric information - you have no idea why and what you are buying, therefore can&amp;#39;t make an informed decision - only an emotional one. Equally, this kind of thing pushes panicked, emotional selling. When you don&amp;#39;t know fundamental reasons why you invest in something, when the price dips you will sell. Why? because when your brain asks you the question &amp;#39;shit it is dropping, what do we do?!&amp;#39; - your logical brain won&amp;#39;t have an answer, because you never gave it the information to form one. This second part is more relevant to regular investments, not PnDs of course, but is worth bearing in mind before you invest in anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was the coin relatively stagnant, or has it dipped recently?&lt;/strong&gt; PnDs typically target coins which haven&amp;#39;t moved much recently, or have lower trading volume, this allows for a much easier spiking of the price due to a small change in demand equalling a big change in price. If you look at the charts and it was doing nothing until this big flurry of activity - you are being taken for a ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for the news&lt;/strong&gt;, if it is pumping, don&amp;#39;t listen to people inside the group - search for reasons why something is pumping. If you can&amp;#39;t find anything of value, there probably isn&amp;#39;t anything, and you are gambling on emotional decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The opportunity finds you, you don&amp;#39;t find the opportunity.&lt;/strong&gt; Getting rich off &amp;#39;undervalued&amp;#39; coins, or finding a hidden gem is not easy. They are hidden for a reason. If someone is coming to you with this, remember they are selling. You are buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If someone does approach you, talk to someone else outside of the bubble&lt;/strong&gt; - find another group e.g. &lt;a href=\"/r/CC\"&gt;r/CC&lt;/a&gt;, or other investors - talk to them, get outside perspective before investing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;look for examples of populist sentiment&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you hear things about an other? - e.g. haters, those missing out who are jealous. Are you made to feel like you are part of a special group? The ones with insider information? This is a lie, it is very very common manipulation within populist movements, cults etc - to create a narrative of an other to entrench tribalism within the group. This is done to make you switch your brain off, to rule on emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;is there a recent comparable story that was successful?&lt;/strong&gt; e.g. GME (yes this isn&amp;#39;t the same at all in reality, but the story being sold is - or at least plays on the hype of GME). If there is, you are being played. The real opportunity, just like the hidden gem, is the first one. When people tell you this is happening again, they are simply using the positive news from one case and applying it to their own - often because it lacks any actual, real, tangible reason for succeeding or being a good investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I fell for a PnD, what next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you sold yet - No? Are you in profit?&lt;/strong&gt; Sell. Whilst you still can. Greed will tell you not to, and perhaps you can eek out a little more money. But you are gambling, and gambling extremely high risk against people trying to take all your money.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, you have sold. Did you make a profit? Yes&lt;/strong&gt; - great. You are still a an idiot, just a lucky one. Tell yourself that. There is a difference between opportunist traders taking advantage of PnDs and someone getting lucky and getting out before it collapses. Do not confuse the two. The first group know what they are doing (and they may still lose, but they are aware of the real risk). You are fucking lucky. Don&amp;#39;t do it again. So count your blessings, go through the same process of learning about PnDs and begin to understand why you fell for it, how to avoid it in future and realise you are up - you won. Don&amp;#39;t go back in, you are asking to lose.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes you have sold? Did you make profit? No?&lt;/strong&gt; Ok, this is normal - 90% + of people doing this will end up in the same situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognise and accept your mistake&lt;/strong&gt;. Do not feel ashamed of it, it is ok. You were played, it happens to all of us in our lives at some point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step away&lt;/strong&gt; from whatever device you used to invest. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WIN IT BACK RIGHT AWAY. You will most likely make things worse, investing again on emotions - even worse emotions now, shame, anger, disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk&lt;/strong&gt; to the important people in your life if you feel comfortable, if not, come here or to other anonymous groups for support. It is important to share what happened, to vent emotionally whatever it is you feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realise it is only money&lt;/strong&gt;, even if gambled way more than you should have done, long term you will get out of this. Focus on other areas of your life for the time being - emotional investment, fulfilment and development - seek out things which may centre to your emotions again, whatever that may be - getting out in nature, cooking, reading, adrenaline sports - whatever the shit you need, do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider who, if anyone needs to know.&lt;/strong&gt; Did you borrow from you and your wife&amp;#39;s joint account? Accept a loan from a mate? These people need to know the truth. Do not hide it and hope to win it back. Tell the truth. They deserve it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not repeat the same actions&lt;/strong&gt;, if you want to win long term from this - you need a different approach. Step away from the high stakes casino and figure out long term strategies to make money. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn to diversify and manage risk&lt;/strong&gt;. You are taking a huge gamble going all in on something - even if it isn&amp;#39;t a scam, you need to protect yourself through diversifying your investments. Get rich quick schemes are the fastest way to lose money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educate yourself on these behaviours&lt;/strong&gt; - I would recommend &lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;Thinking Fast and Slow&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; by Daniel Kahnemann as a personal favourite. This book helps to look at and address the biases that make up our emotional decision making, and learn how to recognise these and instead &amp;#39;think slow&amp;#39;. You won&amp;#39;t regret reading it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","author":"Anhowa123","ts":1612296313},"lba79f":{"id":"lba79f","title":"A New Investor's Guide to Cryptocurrency","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lba79f/a_new_investors_guide_to_cryptocurrency/","text":"**INTRODUCTION:**\n\nWith the recent chaos in the financial markets, both stock and crypto, there's been a massive influx of new investors to our community. As of the time of me writing, we're the number 8 fastest growing community on Reddit! I think it's important that we use this chance to educate our newcomers so that they'll be better equipped to navigate this often confusing space and hopefully be able to contribute to the discussion in the future.\n\nThe objective of this post will be to explain some of the most important concepts that you'll encounter while investing in cryptocurrency. (I won't be covering the details of the technology in this post- for that, I recommend 3Blue1Brown's \"But how does bitcoin actually work?\" on Youtube. While it's tailored to Bitcoin, it explains the ins and outs of a basic blockchain.)\n\n**VALUE FUNDAMENTALS:**\n\nSPOT PRICE - This is the price that you frequently see associated with each coin. This is the price that you can expect to buy or sell at and have your order processed immediately. A \"Market Buy\" will immediately find you the lowest price seller, while a \"Market Sell\" will find you the highest price buyer. Alternatively, you can place a \"Limit Buy\" and name a price. For example, if coin X has a spot price of 140USD, you can set a Limit Buy for 135USD. This order will only execute once the price of coin X drops to 135USD or lower. The same applies to a Limit Sell, if the price rises to your chosen price or higher.\n\nCIRCULATING SUPPLY - This is the number of any given coin that has been placed into the open market. Bitcoin, for example, currently has a circulating supply of 19 million coins. This is also the overall supply, as there is no governing body that holds the coin in reserve. Stellar is an example of differing circulating and total supplies; while there are 22.3 billion Stellar Lumens circulating, there are a total of 50 billion in existence. This is because Stellar has a non-profit governing body that holds roughly 27.7 billion Stellar Lumens in reserve to use for development and promotion.\n\nMARKET CAP -  This is the overall valuation of a cryptocurrency. Simply put, \"Price x Supply = Market Cap\". For example, if coin X has a spot price of 20 dollars and a supply of 20 million, the market cap would be 400 million dollars. This is a better indicator of value than just the price. For example, XLM has a current price of 0.34USD, while AAVE is priced at 301.56USD. This would lead one to believe that AAVE is more valuable overall but 1000x, but it actually has just under half the market cap of XLM (3.7B vs 7.5B) due to vast supply differences. This is the issue with the \"DOGE TO A DOLLAR\" claim. It looks possible because it's a 96 cent movement in price, but the reality is that DOGE would have to increase by 125 Billion USD in overall valuation.\n\nVOLUME - The number of coins traded over a period of time, almost always 24h. This is hard to provide concrete examples for, but is something you can get a feel for over time. A very rough explanation of this concept, is that higher volume trading is more representative of an accurate valuation. This is why you may see a coin's price drift around during off hours, then suddenly snap up or down along with comments in the daily thread saying \"Europe just woke up!\"\n\n**MISCELLANEOUS TERMS:**\n\nHODL - Long term holding, especially through dips. Running joke in the crypto community, but also good advice.\n\nDCA - Dollar Cost Averaging. This is an investing method where you buy small amounts over a period of time rather than a large amount all at once. This reduces your exposure to short-term volatility and is often recommended during dips.\n\nATH - All Time High. A new highest price that a particular coin has seen.\n\nKYC - Know Your Customer. A set of regulations from governments that require exchanges to collect information on their customers. This is why you may be asked for your driver's license or SSN.\n\nDeFi - Decentralized Finance. An ecosystem of permissionless banking, loans, and trading largely based on Ethereum.\n\nCeFi - Centralized Finance. Banking, loans, and trading that require a central authority. Coinbase is an example of a CeFi brokerage, while UniSwap is an example of a DeFi brokerage.\n\nERC-20 Token - Any of a variety of tokens that are based on Ethereum. Examples include BAT, OMG, etc.\n\nHardware Wallet/Cold Storage: A method of storing cryptocurrency using a specialized external device that protects your private key from being exposed. You can access this wallet using your Hardware Wallet and PIN, or by putting your recovery phrase into any hardware wallet.\n\n**YOU SHOULD KNOW:**\n\n-NEVER SHARE YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE. No one with hood inteions will EVER ask you for this. If your recovery phrase is entered into any electronic device other than a hardware wallet, assume you've been compromised.\n\n-Do your own research. A lot of people are going to spam you with their favorite coin and pretend it has zero weaknesses. They do not care about you, they are trying to pump their coin.\n\n-Cryptocurrency is an extremely volatile asset. +/-20% days are very common. Don't panic buy, don't panic sell.\n\n-Do not invest more than you can afford to lose. The risks and rewards of crypto investing are both massive. On a related note, do not touch margin/leverage unless you are 100% sure what you're doing. You can and likely will lose MORE than you put in.\n\n-Not your keys, not your crypto. Some exchanges, such as Robinhood or PayPal, allow you to \"buy\" crypto but don't allow you to send or withdraw it. You do not own this crypto, you own the right to track the price of their crypto. It is strongly recommended that you use an exchange that let's you withdraw your coins to an external wallet.\n\n-Our daily threads run 24/7. If you want to bounce ideas around or join in the hype, hop on in. We don't bite.\n\n-NEVER SHARE YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE.\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nThis is generally a friendly and welcoming community. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask here or in the daily thread and myself or someone else will be more than happy to help you. In the near future, I plan to do this kind of post covering individual currencies. Let me know if you have suggestions or things you'd like to see.\n\nGood luck and happy hodling.","html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;INTRODUCTION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the recent chaos in the financial markets, both stock and crypto, there&amp;#39;s been a massive influx of new investors to our community.

I have only been on Reddit for a few months but I learned so much from it that I figured I should try and give back to the community. English is my second language and this is the first time I ever write a full-length article, I hope you will enjoy reading it and I would be very thankful if you could provide some feedback about my writing, about the topic, or about anything else really… So here goes!*  \n\n\n**Why you should learn poker and game theory:**\n\nMy story is similar to that of many: I learned about the game 10 years ago (during the golden age of online poker) when some friends of mine invited me to play a home game. Although I initially thought of poker as just another game of chance akin to playing slots or roulette in a casino, I quickly came to realize that there is a lot more to it as my more experienced friends would repeatedly get the best of me during these home games, which led me to start watching videos and reading strategy books to improve my skill… Little did I know it’d be the start of a journey that would impact many different aspects of my life way beyond the game itself, as most of the fundamental principles learned through poker can be applied to your decision-making outside of the game, especially when it comes to money management and investing. Now, let’s dive into a few of these principles:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Risk management (i.e. Bankroll management)**\n\nWhen learning about how to be successful playing poker, the first big piece of advice most people come across is bankroll management or BRM. To understand BRM, you must first realize that poker has a lot of variance: you might be vastly ahead in a given hand but there is almost always a slim chance that you will lose in the end if one specific card hits. This implies that you will sometimes lose even though you were a 99% favorite, and that you will sometimes get unlucky and lose 2, 5 or maybe even 20 such encounters in a row. THIS is variance. It doesn’t mean that you played bad or that you made bad decisions, but rather that you got unlucky. Over time you will have lucky streaks and unlucky streaks, and these will average out in the long term… It’s just the way the game goes.\n\nNow that we understand variance, let’s get back to BRM. What is it exactly? Let’s say you are the best poker player in the world but you only have 1000$ that you can EVER use to play with. Taking your whole 1000$ on one table and multiplying your stack at an exponential rate might seem like a good idea. Surely nothing can go wrong since you’re the best player in the world right? But variance can be a bitch ;) Even if you’re the best you will lose regularly and you will sometimes get unlucky, it’s just part of the game. The correct move here is to apply BRM, which means only using a small % of your available capital for each game you play in order to reduce the risk of going broke. Using only 100$ per game would already be a lot safer, but you still run the risk of going under on a streak of bad luck. If you only allocate 10$ per game you play, then it becomes virtually impossible for you to ever go broke, even on a huge streak of bad luck. Sure it’s not as exciting and you won’t be making money quite as fast as you could, but this is the way to go to make sure you don’t go broke…\n\nThis approach to risk management translates very well to investing:\n\n\\- **Only invest what you can afford to lose.** Once the money is on the table it’s as good as gone, which is why you should only use your “spare” cash and never invest with your living expenses or worse, borrow money to invest. \n\n\\- **Diversify your investments.** There is always a chance, however slim it might be, that you will lose most of your investment. This is why going all-in on a specific investment is generally a bad idea (this applies particularly well in the crypto space).\n\nProper BRM allows you to make sure that you will come out ahead in the long run if you play well, which basically comes down to making more good decisions than bad ones. But that’s assuming you don’t let emotions come in the way of your decision-making, which brings us to our next point…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Emotional management (i.e. Handling tilt/Positive mindset)**\n\nNobody likes losing… In the same way we enjoy winning because of the dopamine rush, we feel bad when we lose which is totally natural. Overcoming this and avoiding tilt (irrational decisions made out of anger/frustration) is an essential skill for any successful poker player. You might play a sound game of poker and apply good BRM, but you will still lose if you let your emotions get the best of you. \n\nAfter a loss, rather than being angry and frustrated, you should evaluate your decision-making. If your decision-making was good, you just got unlucky and you shouldn’t worry about it since you are playing for the long run (remember that variance teaches us that anything can happen in the short-term). If your decision-making was bad, you need to learn from your mistakes and move on. The key here is to always have a positive mindset: making mistakes is part of the learning process and should be seen as an occasion to improve. Being angry and ranting, on the other hand, rarely result in anything positive.\n\nAgain, this translates very well to investing:\n\n\\- **Don’t be impulsive, don’t let your emotions cloud your judgment.** You should not FOMO because the price is pumping, nor should you sell because of FUD or price corrections. If you believe in a project, short-term price changes (did I hear someone say “variance”?) shouldn’t bother you.\n\n\\- **Don’t get stuck up on losses.** You bought the top and it crashed immediately after? You sold the bottom right before a huge rally? Don’t let this bother you: what’s done is done and you just need to move on and make the best of your current situation.\n\n\\- **Have a positive mindset.** Anger and frustration lead to nothing. Yes you could have bought in 2009 when you first heard about it, hindsight is always 20/20. Stay positive and keep learning/improving yourself.\n\nThe good thing about all this is that it goes way beyond poker or investing. Being aware of your emotions and how they affect you, learning how to handle losing even when you were “supposed” to win, etc… All this can tremendously help you in all aspects of life by making you less impulsive and more rational in your decision-making. Now, this leaves us with our last fundamental principle of a sound poker strategy:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Basic stats and probabilities (i.e. Expected value/Odds)**\n\nTo become an accomplished player, you will inevitably have to learn about these simple mathematical tools that poker players use all the time in their decision-making process, such as odds and expected value. To make it very simple, the expected value (EV) of any bet is ***(REWARD \\* WinRate - RISK)***, meaning that if you can bet 1000$ with a chance to win 10k$ half of the time, your EV is ***(10000\\*0.5)-1000 = +4000$***. Obviously these are great odds to take as long as you have enough capital to overcome variance. But things would be very different if the odds of winning were only 5% as your EV would then be negative ***(10000\\*0.05)-1000 = -500$.*** Now this is clearly a bet you should not take…\n\nNow that you know probabilities, statistics and game theory are useful decision-making tools in poker, guess what? They are also extremely useful in investing! Even better, the study of game theory with problems such as the “Byzantine generals” or the “Three prisoners” has been, along with cryptography, the foundation on which blockchain technology was built, enabling the trustless and decentralized services that are about to revolutionize our world… \n\nAssuming this was enough to pique your interest and make you want to dig deeper, I’ll just add that just like the other topics we discussed and as you might have guessed, this translates very well to investing and also to pretty much anything in your life:\n\n\\- **Learn how to break down complex situations.** Logical thinking paired with a statistical approach will help you break down any complex problem into several easier problems, making the whole thing a lot easier to approach/comprehend.\n\n\\- **Base your decisions on a methodical and rational approach.** List every possible outcome along with its associated upside/downside, estimate the probability of each outcome to occur and make the best decision based on the information available.\n\nMy point here is that risk management, emotional management and statistics/game theory are all awesome tools that you should definitely add to your arsenal. Not only will it improve your money-management and investing, it will also be beneficial to your decision-making and to your life in general. Of course poker is not the only way to learn about these, but I personally found it to be the best practice ground to refine and improve them, which is why I strongly encourage you all to try it out and study the game. \n\nI hope you enjoyed the article, and I wish you all a happy 2021 bull run! May we all come closer to retirement and financial independence!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***TL;DR:*** *more than a game, poker is a school of thought. It teaches you to be reasonable, to assess the risk of every single choice you make, to overcome you emotions, to play the long game rather than the short game, to make informed decisions, etc… This has made me a lot wiser in every aspect of my life, which is why I strongly encourage to try it out and read about poker strategy.*","html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello everyone!

This is a problem with decentralization that we as a community need to step up to the plate and address.\n\nI’m not quite sure how to flair this but I think this is an important conversation to have and I don’t see anyone having it.\n\nThe more I dig into Uniswap the more fake erc20 tokens I’m finding... im not going to list them all here but I’ve accounted over $50,000,000 in liquidity for FAKE tokens. For the sake of this discussion let’s focus on just one, DOGE-ETH. Go ahead and check the pair on Uni and take a look at the “DOGE” ETH contract. For those unaware, DOGE runs on its own chain and it isn’t a erc20 token. My only explanation is that someone created an ETH token, called it DOGE and deployed it to Uniswap?\n\nI’m an experienced trader, I’ve used Ethereum for many years and even I caught myself one click away from buying a substantial amount of a fake token I thought was legitimate (Polymath).\n\nWhat’s bizarre is these fake tokens exist period.  They follow the prices of the actual assets and I’ve yet to see a rug pull on one of them. To me this feels extremely unhealthy and makes me uneasy about Uniswap in general. It’s like a house of cards ready to collapse and I’d hate to see the market devastated by the longer term repercussions on these fake tokens.\n\nWhat’s even worse is that I’ve been actively reporting these tokens I find in the official subs of these projects I’ve discovered to be fake.

This is a problem with decentralization that we as a community need to step up to the plate and address.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite sure how to flair this but I think this is an important conversation to have and I don’t see anyone having it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The more I dig into Uniswap the more fake erc20 tokens I’m finding... im not going to list them all here but I’ve accounted over $50,000,000 in liquidity for FAKE tokens. For the sake of this discussion let’s focus on just one, DOGE-ETH. Go ahead and check the pair on Uni and take a look at the “DOGE” ETH contract. For those unaware, DOGE runs on its own chain and it isn’t a erc20 token. My only explanation is that someone created an ETH token, called it DOGE and deployed it to Uniswap?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m an experienced trader, I’ve used Ethereum for many years and even I caught myself one click away from buying a substantial amount of a fake token I thought was legitimate (Polymath).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What’s bizarre is these fake tokens exist period.  They follow the prices of the actual assets and I’ve yet to see a rug pull on one of them. To me this feels extremely unhealthy and makes me uneasy about Uniswap in general. It’s like a house of cards ready to collapse and I’d hate to see the market devastated by the longer term repercussions on these fake tokens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What’s even worse is that I’ve been actively reporting these tokens I find in the official subs of these projects I’ve discovered to be fake.
